Millions more are at risk before full recovery. It is the poor and \nmost vulnerable who are hit the hardest from the impoverishing e \ufb00 ects of illness.\nThe Africa Region is the last frontier for health insurance. In many countries, it does \nnot exist at all and, in others, it is in a nascent phase of development. The challenge of \nintroducing health insurance starts with reaching a clear understanding of the problem countries are trying to address with this type of \ufb01 nancing system and designing an af-introducing health insurance starts with reaching a clear understanding of the problem countries are trying to address with this type of \ufb01 nancing system and designing an af-\nfordable system that includes the poor. As seen in Nigeria, passing a law does not guar-antee its successful introduction at the national level. And some countries, like Ghana, \nhave pushed ahead with well-designed schemes that provide extensive coverage for the \npoor, but the devil is in the detail during implementation. Programs succeed and fail not to so much because of brilliant design but because of ability to implement them success-fully and manage political and consumer expectations. \nThis handbook is not intended as an advocacy for or against health insurance. It \nprovides the ABCs of \u201chow\u201d\u2014not \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014to introduce health insurance in low-income countries, with a particular focus on the Africa Region.\nIshrat Husain, Health Adviser,\nAfrica Region, USAID\nJames Christopher Lovelace, Senior Adviser,Ishrat Husain, Health Adviser,\nAfrica Region, USAID\nJames Christopher Lovelace, Senior Adviser, \nAfrica Region, The World Bank\nAlexander S.

It builds on an expanding body of research on securing \nsustainable \ufb01 nancing and \ufb01 nancial protection supported and undertaken by the World \nBank Group, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and \nothers. \nThis recent research has shown that low-income populations are particularly vul-\nnerable to the impoverishing e \ufb00 ects of illness. But they are also often excluded from \nhealth insurance schemes and not well targeted by government- \ufb01 nanced programs. \nSuccess in improving access and \ufb01 nancial protection through community and pri-\nvate voluntary health insurance has led many countries to a \u0134 empt to make membership \ncompulsory and to o \ufb00 er subsidized insurance through the public sector. Arguments in \nfavor of this approach include the potential for achieving higher population coverage,compulsory and to o \ufb00 er subsidized insurance through the public sector. Arguments in \nfavor of this approach include the potential for achieving higher population coverage, \nbroadening the risk pool by collecting at source from formally employed workers, and \ncollective action in securing value for money in purchasing health care from providers.\nBut implementing insurance schemes is complicated and requires careful planning \nduring the design phase as well as continued adjustments during implementation. \nCountries face di \ufb03  cult trade-o \ufb00 s in terms of the depth and breadth of the bene \ufb01 ts \npackage, especially in severely resource-constrained environments. An a \u0134 empt to rap-\nidly expand population coverage in low-income countries may end up compromising the adequacy of the bene \ufb01 ts package in terms of the range and e \ufb00 ectiveness of services \nprovided. This can undermine the policy objective of both access and \ufb01 nancial protec-provided. This can undermine the policy objective of both access and \ufb01 nancial protec-\ntion for the poor if patients end up having to pay out-of-pocket for a signi \ufb01 cant range of \nservices not covered under the publicly mandated bene \ufb01 ts. \nWe hope that this handbook will help policy makers and implementers ask ques-\ntions that will help them design be \u0134 er schemes and reduce the costs and risks during \nimplementation.\nHong Wang\nKimberly Switlick\nChristine Ortiz\nBeatriz Zurita\nCatherine Connor", "14": "xiiiAcknowledgments\nThis report is reproduced, with minor stylistic and forma \u0134 ing changes, by permission \nof the Health Systems 20 \u200a/\u200a20 project, funded by the United States Agency for Inter-\nnational Development (USAID) and led by Abt Associates Inc.

Introduction\nMany countries that subscribe to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have \ncommi\u0134 ed to ensuring access to basic health services for their citizens. Health insurance \nhas been considered and promoted as the major \ufb01 nancing mechanism to improve access \nto health services, as well as to provide \ufb01 nancial risk protection. \nIn Africa, several countries have already spent scarce time, money, and e \ufb00 ort on \nhealth insurance initiatives. Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Tanzania \nare just a few of them. However, many of these schemes, both public and private, cover only a small proportion of the population, with the poor less likely to be covered. In fact, unless carefully designed to be pro-poor, health insurance can widen inequity as higher income groups are more likely to be insured and use health care services, taking advan-tage of their insurance coverage. \nDespite the many bene \ufb01 ts that health insurance may o \ufb00 er, table 1.1 shows that theDespite the many bene \ufb01 ts that health insurance may o \ufb00 er, table 1.1 shows that the \njourney to implement insurance and achieve the bene \ufb01 ts is challenging, long, and risky. \nPolicy makers and technicians that support development and scale-up of health insur-ance must \ufb01 gure out how to increase their country\u2019s \ufb01 nancing capacity, extend health \ninsurance coverage to the hard-to-reach populations, expand bene \ufb01 ts packages, and im-\nprove the performance of existing schemes. \nTable 1.1.

Stakeholder views and support will determine how a country will address all the next seven design elements and overall feasibility. The introduction of \ninsurance in developing countries involves multiple government ministries, health care \nproviders, consumers, employers, and donors. Policy makers and technical experts must work together to manage expectations, ensure decision making based on facts and tech-nical analysis, and \ufb01 nd common ground among competing interest groups. Policy mak-\ners must understand and be able to articulate the following:\n\u25a0 How will insurance contribute to overall national objectives?\n\u25a0 How will insurance combat poverty and contribute to great equity?\n\u25a0 Who are the major stakeholders and what are their positions on health insurance \ndevelopment or scale-up?\n\u25a0 What are potential political obstacles?\u25a0 Who are the major stakeholders and what are their positions on health insurance \ndevelopment or scale-up?\n\u25a0 What are potential political obstacles? \n\u25a0 What are possible mitigation strategies?\n\u25a0 How can a political coalition be built that will be able to push health insurance reforms and successfully keep them on the political agenda? \nBuilding Political Consensus\nPolitical mapping can help understand what level of political support exists for di \ufb00 erent \naspects of health insurance design and implementation. It can help identify where sup-port already exists, where it is lacking, and what strategies may be necessary to build \nconsensus. \nPolitical mapping can be done in di \ufb00 erent ways.

For example, community-based health insurance is \nmore likely to be feasible in a country where ethnic or geographic groups demonstrate \nhigh social cohesion. A social health insurance scheme may be more appropriate for a \ncountry with larger number of formal sector employees or with a strong sense of na-tional solidarity among the population (boxes 2.2 and 2.3).\nBox 2.2. Insurance is a Bad Word \nAt the beginning of the movement to establish community-based health insurance schemes in \nWest Africa, organizers avoided the word \u201cinsurance\u201d because people had poor experiences with property, life, and other kinds of insurance. Claims were paid slowly, if at all. The term \n\u201dmutual health organization\u201d (Mutuelle in French) was more socially acceptable because it\u201dmutual health organization\u201d (Mutuelle in French) was more socially acceptable because it \nemphasized social cohesion and people\u2019s positive experience with mutual aid societies.\n \nBox 2.3. National Solidarity and Attitudes toward Redistributive Mechanisms \nSeveral recent examples\u2014C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria, and the United States\u2014arguably \ndemonstrate that lack of national solidarity can impede the chances of successful health insurance reform. Europe, especially after the World War II, illustrates the case that strong \nnational solidarity facilitates reforms. \nSimilarly, ready acceptance of relatively high marginal tax rates is a facilitating factor for suc-\ncess as well, especially as the incidence of such taxes usually falls most heavily on the rich. Such progressive taxes often constitute a precondition for \ufb01 nancially feasible social health \ninsurance as seen in Europe, or even Ghana and Rwanda.insurance as seen in Europe, or even Ghana and Rwanda.  \nHealth insurance is more likely to be feasible when peoples\u2019 expectations and tech-\nnical design decisions are aligned. For example, if the government\u2019s expectation of an ap-\npropriate level of citizen contribution exceeds that of the general population, there will \nlikely be pushback and noncompliance with revenue collection. To ensure this kind of \nalignment, policy makers may need to assess the population\u2019s expectations and willing-\nness-to-pay for insurance, perhaps via a household survey or qualitative data collection. \nCultural norms can strongly a \ufb00 ect the ultimate success of an insurance programness-to-pay for insurance, perhaps via a household survey or qualitative data collection. \nCultural norms can strongly a \ufb00 ect the ultimate success of an insurance program \n(boxes 2.2 and 2.3). For instance, some people downplay the risks of ill health while others are strongly risk-averse. In some societies, people believe that planning for a bad situation, such as ill health, may bring bad luck. Popular beliefs vary greatly as to wheth-er social or economic equity is an important national objective, and the extent to which caring for the poor and the sick should be the responsibility of the larger population. \nThese strongly held social beliefs set the boundaries of what is culturally feasible for a \nnational health insurance program. In some cases, the coexistence of multiple types of insurance and health care providers is the result of what has been deemed socially and economically acceptable to di \ufb00 erent groups. A possible way to reduce this fragmenta-tion could be to establish a minimum package of care for a vulnerable group that society has identi \ufb01 ed as \u201cworthy\u201d of a subsidy\u2014such as the poor, unemployed, low-income, \nhandicapped, elderly, children, or women.", "23": "World Bank Working Paper 8\nService Availability, Quality, and Provider Capacity \nService availability and provider capacity a \ufb00 ect feasibility at two levels:\n\u25a0 The physical presence of health workers and facilities near enough to target popu-\nlations and their capacity to deliver quality services covered by insurance (do they have the skills, equipment, and supplies?).

In some schemes, cross-subsidization from the wealthy \nto the poor may be an additional goal. Health insurance can be \ufb01 nanced and managed \nin various ways (box 3.1).

Often, the government \ndirectly provides health services as well. The best-known example is the British National \nHealth Service. This approach is also known as the Beveridge model, originating from \nthe Beveridge report of 1942.", "26": "Health Insurance Handbook 11\nPremium  is the amount to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage. \nThe premium depends on the bene \ufb01 ts to be covered by the insurance (the bene \ufb01 ts pack-\nage), the cost of those bene \ufb01 ts, and estimates of the likelihood that the insured indi-\nvidual or group will use the bene \ufb01 ts. \nRisk pooling  is the collection of funds from members of a group to \ufb01 nance the cost of \na speci \ufb01 c event (such as \ufb01 re, illness, car accident). Risk pooling ensures that the \ufb01 nancial \nrisk of paying for unpredictable costs is borne by all the members of the group, instead \nof the individual, and protects individuals from catastrophic costs. In the case of health insurance, individuals are protected from the catastrophic costs of illness. The larger and more diverse the group\u2014including rich and poor, men and women, old and young, healthy and unhealthy \u2015the more e \ufb00 ectively health insurance spreads risk.Private voluntary health insurance  is distributed by private for-pro \ufb01 t or not-for-pro \ufb01 t \ncompanies. Premiums are based on the purchaser\u2019s risk rather than his or her ability to pay. PVHI can be purchased on an individual or a group basis. It can provide primary coverage, or it may be purchased to supplement another health insurance policy (\u201csec-ondary health insurance\u201d). Unregulated PVHI can lead to escalating costs; competition for healthy, wealthy populations (cream-skimming); and avoidance of sick, poor popu-lations. However, well-regulated PVHI can serve as the primary \ufb01 nancial protection for \nworkers and their families, while public funds can target the poor. PVHI may also be a transitional form of health insurance to develop local capacity to manage and \ufb01 nance \nhealth care (Sekhri and Savedo \ufb00  2005).\n \nSocial health insurance5 (SHI) generally has four features: (1) independent or quasi-\nindependent management of insurance funds (such as by social security institutes orSocial health insurance5 (SHI) generally has four features: (1) independent or quasi-\nindependent management of insurance funds (such as by social security institutes or \nsickness funds); (2) compulsory earmarked payroll contributions; (3) a direct link be-\ntween the contributions and de \ufb01 ned medical bene \ufb01 ts for the insured population; and \n(4) concept of social solidarity. Social health insurance is sometimes referred to as the \nBismarck model re \ufb02 ecting its origin in Germany.

Hence, low-income countries face real constraints to raising revenues to \ufb01 nance health in general, and health insurance speci \ufb01 cally. Low-income countries are \nlikely to have high fertility rates that result in a majority of the population being under \n15. This is referred to as a high dependency ratio \u2014when there are many more dependents \n(children and elderly who cost more than they contribute) than working-age population (who typically contribute more than they cost). \nGovernment tax revenues average about 15 percent of GDP in low-income coun-\ntries, compared with more than 20 percent among higher-income countries. If all coun-tries in sub-Saharan Africa were able to meet the Abuja target and allocate 15 percent of government \ufb01 nancing to health, 23 countries still would not reach $34 per capita health", "27": "World Bank Working Paper 12\nspending\u2014the cost of a basic package of essential health interventions, as estimated by \nthe Commission on Macroeconomics and Health in 2001. A projection analysis shows that even under optimistic assumptions about economic growth, population growth, \nand tax revenue collection, most sub-Saharan African countries will not reach $34 per \ncapita even by 2020 (Atim et al. 2008). \nIn addition to income constraints, \ufb01 nancing is limited by the size of the formal sector \neconomy from which taxes and payroll contributions can be collected.

MMI, also a social health insurance scheme, covers all military personnel. The \ncontribution rate is 22.5 percent (5 percent paid by the employee and 17.5 percent by the government). \nAMCs are mutuelles  whose members live in predominantly rural se \u0134 ings and work \nin the informal sector. Once considered a partial solution to health \ufb01 nancing but unlikely \nto lead to universal coverage, the AMCs have been unexpectedly successful in Rwanda. Although enrolment is voluntary, AMCs grew to cover 5.7 million Rwandans, 75 percent of the population, by 2007. This accomplishment is partly a \u0134 ributable to strong politi-cal will on the part of Rwanda\u2019s leadership, community outreach by insurance workers \n(animateurs de sant\u00e9) to enroll AMC members, and the complementary roles of the MOH \nthat manages and funds service provision (health centers and district hospitals, and a \nresults-based \ufb01 nancing system) and the Ministry of Local Government that administers \nthe AMCs. Fifty percent of the funding for AMCs comes from annual member premi-ums; the other half is subsidized by the government (through general tax revenues) and donor support. The national network of mutuelles e \ufb03  ciently distributes funding from \nthe government, donors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as premium sub-sidies that target the poorest. \nRwanda has seen several improvements in health \ufb01 nancing indicators, including \ngreater availability of \ufb01 nancial resources for health ($34 per capita in 2007 comparedRwanda has seen several improvements in health \ufb01 nancing indicators, including \ngreater availability of \ufb01 nancial resources for health ($34 per capita in 2007 compared \nwith $13 in 1999), increased coverage of the rural and informal sector population (from 1.2 percent in 1999 to 75.6 percent in 2007), and lower out-of-pocket payments (from \n24.7 percent of total health expenditure in 2000 to 15.9 percent in 2005).

In the case of health insurance, adverse selection occurs when more people with high expected health costs (e.g., those with pre-existing health conditions or the \nelderly) elect to enroll than do those with low expected costs (healthy, young people).elderly) elect to enroll than do those with low expected costs (healthy, young people). \nAdverse selection is possible with voluntary insurance schemes, only when people have a choice between enrolling or not enrolling. Adverse selection can reduce risk sharing and lead to premium escalation, as the cost of services is higher than expected.\nBene \ufb01 ciary  is the insured person, the individual who is covered by the health insur-\nance scheme. He \u200a/\u200ashe may also be referred to as a subscriber, member, or enrollee. \nBene \ufb01 ciary population  is the group of people covered by health insurance.\nDirect targeting  is the provision of free or reduced-price health insurance coverage to \ncategories of the population de \ufb01 ned by a means test. One way is for a third party suchDirect targeting  is the provision of free or reduced-price health insurance coverage to \ncategories of the population de \ufb01 ned by a means test. One way is for a third party such \nas a donor or charity to pay the premiums of the target population. In many countries in Africa, means testing usually occurs at the point of service delivery. Identifying who is eligible is di \ufb03  cult where wage and tax records are often unavailable or nonexistent. \nFacility administrators thus use their discretion to determine who is unable to pay fees, resulting in informal means testing that relies on income proxies. Because of time con-straints on facility administrators and doctors, pressure to waive fees for acquaintances, and unwillingness of sta \ufb00  to grant waivers because their facility needs additional rev-\nenue, eligibility for fee waivers may ultimately be determined in a less-than-systematic manner.\nEligibility  is quali \ufb01 cation for participation.

It can \nalso refer to the characteristics required to access a particular bene \ufb01 t of the health insur-\nance scheme, such as a subsidy. All health insurance programs have their own de \ufb01 ned \neligibility requirements. \nEnrolment  is the act of becoming insured. Enrolment can be passive  as when a gov-\nernment legislates that all citizens are automatically covered or active  as when people \nmust take steps to enroll, such as registering and paying an enrolment fee or premium.\nFormal sector  is the employment sector in which workers have regular hours and are \npaid wages or salaries on which they must pay income taxes.", "32": "Health Insurance Handbook 17\nHealth equity  is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major so-\ncial determinants of health) between groups with di \ufb00 erent levels of underlying social \nadvantage \u200a/\u200adisadvantage, such as wealth, power, or prestige.

For \nexample, all citizens of the United Kingdom are enrolled in the National Health Service.\nVoluntary enrolment  means that individuals can choose to be covered by the health \ninsurance scheme or opt out. When enrolment is voluntary, adverse selection can be a risk because people who are more likely to need medical services are more likely to enroll, and those who are healthier less likely to enroll. Voluntary enrolment also neces-sitates marketing the scheme to eligible people and possibly providing incentives for enrolment to reduce adverse selection.\nImportant Considerations\nIncreasing population coverage with quality services in a cost- e \ufb03  cient and culturally \nacceptable manner is key to the ultimate goal of achieving universal coverage.\nAchieving Universal Coverage \nIn May 2005, the World Health Assembly endorsed Resolution WHA58.33 urging mem-acceptable manner is key to the ultimate goal of achieving universal coverage.\nAchieving Universal Coverage \nIn May 2005, the World Health Assembly endorsed Resolution WHA58.33 urging mem-\nber states to work toward universal coverage and ensure that their total populations have access to needed health interventions without the risk of \ufb01 nancial catastrophe \n(Carrin, Evans, and Xu 2007). Under this resolution, universal coverage incorporates \ntwo complementary dimensions in addition to \ufb01 nancial risk protection: the extent of \npopulation coverage (who is covered) and the extent of health service coverage (bene \ufb01 ts \ncovered\u2014see Element 4).\nOnly a few countries have achieved universal coverage, such as Denmark, France, \nGermany, Portugal, and the United Kingdom.

However, \nhigher-level redistribution of resources among \ufb01 nancing pools may be possible.\nLinkages between Population Coverage, Financing Mechanism, and Bene \ufb01 ts Package\nInsurers face a trade-o \ufb00  between extending coverage to low-income and high-risk pop-\nulations or covering additional services.

This was started as a pilot project in \ufb01 ve districts at \ufb01 rst and expanded to eight \ndistricts in 2000. \nThe programs merged in 2001 to create the Integrated Health Insurance Programdistricts in 2000. \nThe programs merged in 2001 to create the Integrated Health Insurance Program \n(Seguro Integral de Salud, or SIS) and coverage was extended from the eight pilot dis-tricts to the whole country. The program was targeted to those who could demonstrate \ufb01 nancial need through a screening process that was improved in 2004 (see means test-\ning below). Eligibility expanded to include all children under the age of 18 (whether enrolled in school or not), pregnant women, and adults needing emergency care, if they passed the means test. \nIn 2009, eligibility was extended to include entire families earning less than a certain \nincome, as long as they had no other insurance coverage. Coverage is free of charge for those who are considered in a state of poverty, and is available at a subsidized rate for those with eligible incomes (under approximately $200 per month individual income or $500 per month family income).\n7 SIS, funded predominantly through tax revenues,87 SIS, funded predominantly through tax revenues,8 \ngrew from covering 5,860,000 bene \ufb01 ciaries in 2002 to 10,350,000 in 2008, out of a popula-\ntion 29 million.9 \nIn 2009, Peru passed a Universal Health Insurance Law, which established an over-\nall framework for health insurance reform in Peru. This policy comprises a two-pronged \nstrategy: (1) increasing the breadth of insurance coverage by expanding the number of \npeople with e \ufb00 ective access to quality health services and protection against \ufb01 nancial \nrisk, with an emphasis on the poor; and (2) increasing the depth of insurance coverage by expanding the range and quality of health bene \ufb01 ts according to the current and fu-\nture demographic pro \ufb01 le and epidemiological needs of the population.", "38": "Health Insurance Handbook 23\nMeans Testing to Identify and Subsidize Insurance for the Poor\nIn 2004, SIS, with the technical assistance of the USAID-funded Partners for Health Re-\nform plus project team, developed a mean test index to target health subsidies to the \npoorest in the population, similar to the methodology employed by the National Target-\ning System of Colombia.10 This methodology determines eligibility for SIS based on the \nestimation of a composite index of a household\u2019s economic welfare (box 4.3). \nBox 4.3. SIS Methodology for Means Testing\nHousehold economic status is estimated based on a set of qualitative and quantitative vari-\nables related to the consumption \u200a/\u200aownership of durable goods, human capital endowments, and \nother factors.

Working with the National Household Survey (ENAHO) of 25,000 households, the \nhousehold welfare index was derived using the statistical algorithm of Alternat ing Least Squares \nand Optimal Scaling (Qualitative Principal Components). This algorithm provides (1) a metric for the different categories of the variables collected in the survey for each geographic area, and (2) weights for each variable according to its contribution to the \ufb01 rst principal component \nof the system (which is the unobservable utility index that must be constructed). \nThe \ufb01 nal variables selected by the algorithm were those most ef \ufb01 cient in predicting household \nwelfare differences and poverty. Seguro Integral de Salud easily collected this information in a \nshort interview by applying the Socioeconomic Evaluation Sheet (Ficha de Evaluaci\u00f3n Socio-econ\u00f3mica, or FESE). With the aid of customized software, SIS calculates household welfare \nscores and ranks potential bene \ufb01 ciaries.scores and ranks potential bene \ufb01 ciaries.\n \nSeveral evaluations have shown that these indexes are reasonably good at determin-\ning eligibility for social programs. Although they do not eliminate the undercoverage \nproblem completely, they reduce leakage to wealthier groups, and as a result their ca-\npacity to reduce poverty is signi \ufb01 cantly increased. \nThe methodology was so successful that the Prime Minister\u2019s O \ufb03  ce and the Min-\nistry of Economics adopted the methodology as the basis of the National Household \nTargeting System (SISFOH established by DS. 130-2004-EF) for use in a wide range of subsidized social programs to allocate subsidies to the poor and limit leakage.\nSteps to Address This Element\n\u25a0 Identify who is currently being covered by health insurance in your country.

Actuaries use historical use \ndata, such as claims data, to predict future use pa \u0134 erns. However, claims data are not \navailable in many developing countries.

The bene \ufb01 ts covered are a major driver of the overall cost of the health \ninsurance and the scheme\u2019s political acceptability and marketability to consumers. \nClaim refers to each use of the bene \ufb01 ts covered by insurance, generating payment to \nthe insured person or to a service provider (e.g., doctor, car repair shop). Claims under auto, property, and life insurance are relatively small in volume compared with health insurance claims. \nCoinsurance  refers to the insured person\u2019s payment for a percentage of the cost of \ncovered health care services utilized. For instance, an insurance scheme might cover 80 percent of the costs of a hospital stay; the remaining 20 percent would be the insured person\u2019s coinsurance.\nCopayment refers to a \ufb01 xed payment de \ufb01 ned in the insurance policy and paid by theCopayment refers to a \ufb01 xed payment de \ufb01 ned in the insurance policy and paid by the \ninsured person each time a medical service is accessed.\nCost containment  comprises a variety of techniques to promote e \ufb03  ciency in service \nprovision and use and to avoid unnecessary, wasteful spending.\nDeductible  is a \ufb01 xed amount that must be paid out-of-pocket in a given year before \nan insurer will cover any expenses.\nInsurable risks  are unpredictable, uncommon, and usually high-cost events such as \ncar accidents or cancer that health insurance traditionally is intended to cover. Many \nhealth services that are public health priorities\u2014such as immunization, family planning, \nor health education\u2014are not insurable risks, because they occur with predictable fre-quency and are needed by the bulk of the population. \nMerit goods  are similar to public goods, but they generate both private and public \nbene \ufb01 ts.

Because their total value to society is greater than their private bene \ufb01 t, they \nhave a tendency to be underconsumed. Examples include vaccinations, insecticide-treat-ed bednets, and condoms to prevent HIV. Public and merit health goods are generally not insurable risks, but are highly cost-e \ufb00 ective health system investments.\n11", "40": "Health Insurance Handbook 25\nMoral hazard  occurs when the behavior of an insured person changes\u2014usually to \nbecome less risk-averse\u2014because they no longer bear the full cost of their behavior.

However, increased use of some priority health services (e.g., assisted deliveries) may be a policy objective in developing countries.\nPublic goods  are goods that, when consumed by one person, do not become less \navailable to another person, and which cannot be e \ufb00 ectively withheld from another per-\nson.

The details can include the type of provider, speci \ufb01 c services or conditions covered or \nexcluded, limits on services (e.g., number of days in the hospital), and any copaymentsexcluded, limits on services (e.g., number of days in the hospital), and any copayments \nor deductibles (see cost containment, below). Samples of bene \ufb01 ts packages from Ghana, \nIndia, and the United States are in appendix B. \nWhat Criteria Should Guide Design of the Bene \ufb01 ts Package? \nIn 2001, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (CMH) recommended four cri-\nteria for choosing essential health interventions to be included in bene \ufb01 ts packages: \u201c(1) \nThey should be technically e \ufb03  cacious and can be delivered successfully; (2) the targeted \ndiseases should impose a heavy burden on society, taking into account individual illness \nas well as social spillovers (such as epidemics and adverse economic e \ufb00 ects); (3) social \nbene \ufb01 ts should exceed costs of the interventions (with bene \ufb01 ts including life-years savedas well as social spillovers (such as epidemics and adverse economic e \ufb00 ects); (3) social \nbene \ufb01 ts should exceed costs of the interventions (with bene \ufb01 ts including life-years saved \nand spillovers such as fewer orphans or faster economic growth); and (4) the needs of the poor should be stressed\u201d (CMH 2001: 10). In addition to the CMH criteria, policy makers must also consider the priorities of the population groups that are providing most of the \ufb01 nancing, who may withdraw their political support for an insurance scheme that does \nnot cover services that they value. \nWhat Bene \ufb01 ts Should Your Insurance Scheme Cover?\nGiven resource limitations, most developing countries must make di \ufb03  cult choices be-\ntween covering services most likely to improve the population\u2019s health outcomes and \nservices that protect households from catastrophic health expenditures (box 5.1).", "41": "World Bank Working Paper 26\nBox 5.1. Kyrgyz Republic: Financing Reforms Reduce Costs for the Poor \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s comprehensive health \ufb01 nancing reforms consisted of national-level \npooling of funds, prospective purchasing methods, explicit de \ufb01 nition of bene \ufb01 ts, and downsiz-\ning in the hospital sector. The bene \ufb01 ts package consisted of free primary care for the entire \npopulation and copayment for inpatient care. Due to these reforms, from 2001 to 2004 excess \nhospital capacity was reduced from 1,464 buildings to 784 with a concomitant cost reduction. Conditional on hospitalization, the poorest 40 percent experienced a signi \ufb01 cant increase in \nout-of-pocket payments in control regions but a slight decline in reform regions. For all income groups, reforms were effective in limiting the increase of out-of-pocket payments for hospital-out-of-pocket payments in control regions but a slight decline in reform regions. For all income groups, reforms were effective in limiting the increase of out-of-pocket payments for hospital-\nization by US$10 for an average household. The Kyrgyz experience provides evidence that patient \ufb01 nancial burden may be reduced through more ef \ufb01 cient use of public resources and \nthat in settings with high informal payments, introduction of copayments for hospitalization may not have a negative effect on \ufb01 nancial protection. \nSource:  Yazbeck 2009.  \nTo improve health outcomes, policy makers should consider the population\u2019s bur-\nden of disease, demographics (age, gender, location, and income), mortality and morbid-\nity rates, epidemiological trends, historical data on service use, and evidence regarding \nthe most cost-e \ufb00 ective interventions.12 Many of these services are high in volume, low \nin cost and have high potential for health impact (e.g., family planning, treatment of up-the most cost-e \ufb00 ective interventions.12 Many of these services are high in volume, low \nin cost and have high potential for health impact (e.g., family planning, treatment of up-\nper respiratory infections and infectious diseases). Many are public or merit goods with \nlarge social bene \ufb01 ts (such as immunization), and insurance coverage can help compen-\nsate for low willingness-to-pay for such services. However, these types of services are \nnot considered \u201cinsurable risks\u201d because they are not random and unpredictable. Com-prehensive coverage of these services may be very expensive. For example, HIV \u200a/\u200aAIDS \nprevention, testing, and treatment have high public health value, but need for these ser-vices is common and highly predictable where HIV prevalence is high and many people are likely to use the services.\n13\nTo protect households (especially poor households) from catastrophic costs, house-\nhold surveys and health facility data can be used to analyze the target population\u2019s cur-13\nTo protect households (especially poor households) from catastrophic costs, house-\nhold surveys and health facility data can be used to analyze the target population\u2019s cur-\nrent pa\u0134 ern of out-of-pocket health expenditures: Which medical services are people \nbuying and which tend to be catastrophic for households in the target population?

Health expenditures can be grouped into outpatient and inpatient or diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), based on the design of the bene \ufb01 ts package and provider payment system (see Element 5). If your countrylacks data on the prior year\u2019s health expenditure, it may be possible to estimate based on data from another similar country. Annual increases are due to many factors such as: Increased prices (provider payment rates), increased demand (service utilization), increased use of technology, and changes in the provider payment mechanism (see Ele-ment 5).\nPOLITICAL  CONSIDERATIONS\nPolitical acceptability is of key importance in designing the bene \ufb01 ts package, especially \namong the people who are paying for the insurance. Under a voluntary scheme, if bene \ufb01 -\nciaries are expected to pay the premium, they must understand the concept of insurance \nand \ufb01 nd the bene \ufb01 ts package worth paying for. In many CBHI schemes, the members \ndebate and vote for which bene \ufb01 ts to include. If the government will fund a mandatory \ninsurance scheme through general tax revenues, national health goals are likely to guidedebate and vote for which bene \ufb01 ts to include. If the government will fund a mandatory \ninsurance scheme through general tax revenues, national health goals are likely to guide \ndesign of the bene \ufb01 ts package. In addition, to sustain political support for the national \nscheme, the tax-paying population should perceive the bene \ufb01 ts package as valuable. The \npriorities and political power of the paying population may be at odds with those of the nonpaying, poor population, requiring an incremental, consensus-building approach to expand insurance to nonpaying populations (see Elements 1, 2, and 3).", "44": "Health Insurance Handbook 29\nHow Can Costs of the Bene \ufb01 ts Package Be Contained?\nThe goal of cost containment is to make the insurance scheme solvent and \ufb01 nancially \nself-sustaining. As part of the bene \ufb01 ts package, cost-containment methods can discour-\nage unnecessary, wasteful spending so more funds are available for needed health care \nservices. Some methods can promote quality; others can erode quality and must be close-\nly monitored. Costs are incurred when implementing cost containment. Most methods are annoyances to bene \ufb01 ciaries and providers and require administrative systems and \nlabor to implement. Policy makers must con \ufb01 rm that the cost-containment method saves \nmore money than it costs to put the system in place, run it, and monitor compliance. \nThe bene \ufb01 ts package design process itself can contribute to cost containment. Fig-more money than it costs to put the system in place, run it, and monitor compliance. \nThe bene \ufb01 ts package design process itself can contribute to cost containment. Fig-\nure 5.1 shows how many health insurance plans control costs through deductibles and copayments since these mechanisms control the tendency to overuse health services (moral hazard). These deductibles and copayments, however, may be una \ufb00 ordable to \nthe poorest groups. Some schemes set a ceiling on the bene \ufb01 ts an individual may be paid \nwithin a given time frame, such as a year, although such maximums may leave bene \ufb01 -\nciaries at risk of catastrophic expenditures. Many insurers exclude expensive services such as organ transplants and dialysis. Insurers may cover only generic drugs, or use an essential drugs list. Clear and rational processes, based on evidence of cost e \ufb00 ective-\nness, should always be followed for modifying the bene \ufb01 ts package and reviewing newness, should always be followed for modifying the bene \ufb01 ts package and reviewing new \ninterventions, products, and technologies for possible inclusion. \nFigure 5.1.

Accreditation \nis time limited, and the organization must periodically be re-evaluated to ensure that it continues to meet the standards in order to maintain its accreditation status. There-fore, accreditation not only fosters, but requires, a process of continuous improvement (Shwark 2005).", "48": "Health Insurance Handbook 33\nMarket structure refers  to the characteristics and relative strength of buyers and sellers \nin a market. In the health market, buyers are individuals and purchasing organizations \n(national, single payer; regional payers) and sellers are individual providers and pro-\nvider organizations (such as provider networks or associations of health care facilities). \nThe market structure in \ufb02 uences the types of payment methods that can be established.\nPayment method  is the mechanism used to allocate resources from buyer (insurer, \ngovernment, etc.) to provider. The payment method has an impact on the quantity and quality of care and transaction costs. A payment method can be based on inputs (e.g., salaries or drugs), outputs produced (e.g., patient visits, hospital days, cases treated), or results (e.g., percentage of children in a catchment area fully immunized). Speci \ufb01 c pay-\nment methods are de \ufb01 ned below:ment methods are de \ufb01 ned below:\nFee-for-service  (FFS) is payment per service provided. This may be designed to cover \nall costs incurred by the provider or only to add incentives to encourage providers to de-vote e\ufb00 ort to priority services and have no relationship to providers\u2019 actual costs. Under \nFFS, providers face an incentive to increase the number of services delivered, possibly above what is medically necessary (\u201csupplier-induced demand\u201d) and therefore increase reimbursements from the payer. To manage this, a \ufb01 xed cap (ceiling) on costs or number \nof visits per year may be imposed. FFS can also motivate providers to provide needed services or work longer hours, which may be appropriate for certain target populations. FFS is often used in the private sector and is used in several countries, such as Canada, China, Ghana, Japan, and the United States.\nPer diem payment  is a fee paid to hospitals for each bed-day. This payment methodPer diem payment  is a fee paid to hospitals for each bed-day. This payment method \nincentivizes providers to raise the number of hospital admissions and the length of stay, and even shift some outpatient services to the hospital. Like FFS, per diem payment is \nassociated with cost escalation. To combat this, per diem can be used with a \ufb01 xed cap on \ntotal costs or days per year. The method is simple to implement, and the per diem rate \ncan be adjusted for the hospital\u2019s case mix. Per diem rates based on case mix may be a way of making a transition to a case-based payment system. \nSalary  is the dominant payment method whenever providers are direct employees, \nfor example, in the public health sector and in sta \ufb00 -model health maintenance organiza-Salary  is the dominant payment method whenever providers are direct employees, \nfor example, in the public health sector and in sta \ufb00 -model health maintenance organiza-\ntions (e.g., Kaiser in California). Paying providers a salary can remove their incentive to over- or underprovide care, but it can also remove incentives for high productivity and quality and may be associated with high absenteeism. Combining salary payments with performance-based \ufb01 nancing may help address these negative incentives.\nCapitation  is an advance payment of a predetermined \ufb01 xed amount to providers for \ndelivering a de \ufb01 ned set of services for each bene \ufb01 ciary registered with the provider for a \n\ufb01 xed time period. The payment is not linked to the providers\u2019 incurred costs for treatingdelivering a de \ufb01 ned set of services for each bene \ufb01 ciary registered with the provider for a \n\ufb01 xed time period. The payment is not linked to the providers\u2019 incurred costs for treating \nan individual patient or to the volume of services. Therefore, capitation shifts risk to the provider. If the provider\u2019s costs are higher than the capitation revenue, the provider suf-fers a loss. If the provider\u2019s costs are less than the capitation revenue, the provider keeps a surplus. There is a clear incentive for the provider to be e \ufb03  cient but also potentially \nto reduce quality or withhold needed services. If bene \ufb01 ciaries are free to choose their \nprovider, providers have an incentive to a \u0134 ract healthy bene \ufb01 ciaries.\nCase-based payment  is a \ufb01 xed payment per \u201cmedical-case\u201d category de \ufb01 ned by av-\nerage cost per case, regardless of the actual cost incurred by the provider. This pay-ment method incentivizes providers to reduce inputs and costs per case, for example,", "49": "World Bank Working Paper 34\nby shortening the length of stay in the hospital or shifting services from inpatient to \noutpatient. This method also may create an incentive to increase the number of cases by increasing admissions and unnecessary readmissions. The DRGs used by the U.S. Medi-\ncare insurance program are an example of case-based payment.\nLine-item budget  is one that allocates a \ufb01 xed amount of funds to a provider to cover \nspeci \ufb01 c line items (input costs) such as personnel, utilities, medicines, and supplies for a \ncertain period (e.g., a year). This is the most common method for public primary health \ncare systems such as in Bangladesh, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Mozambique, and Viet-nam. Line-item budgets are not based on outputs, such as number of visits, but they may be adjusted from year-to-year to re \ufb02 ect changes in outputs. \nA global budget  is a \ufb01 xed maximum expenditure, set by the payer, for a de \ufb01 ned set \nof health care services.A global budget  is a \ufb01 xed maximum expenditure, set by the payer, for a de \ufb01 ned set \nof health care services.\n17 The size of the budget may be set by an assessment of projected \nhealth needs or relative to an objective metric, such as a proportion of gross domestic \nproduct. For example, provinces in Canada allocate annual budgets to hospitals each year. \nGlobal budgets for health are intended to constrain both the level and rate of increase in \nhealth care costs by limiting them directly. Facilities or systems that face a global budget have clear incentives to control costs and operate e \ufb03  ciently.

For example, \ninstitutional deliveries have the highest payment rate (US$4.59), leading providers to not only \nencourage women to deliver in the facility during prenatal visits but also commission commu-\nnity health workers to reach out to pregnant women in the community (Basinga et al. 2010).  \nProvider contract  is the wri \u0134 en, legal agreement between a buyer and health care \nservice providers for delivering health care paid by insurance. \nPurchasing  is the transfer of resources from buyers to service providers in exchange \nfor the delivery of services to bene \ufb01 ciaries.Purchasing  is the transfer of resources from buyers to service providers in exchange \nfor the delivery of services to bene \ufb01 ciaries. \nThird-party administrator  (TPA) is a company that provides administrative services to \ninsurance companies or self-funded health plans.", "50": "Health Insurance Handbook 35\nImportant Considerations\nThe methods by which health care providers are selected, engaged, and paid are key to \nthe e\ufb03  ciency of the system as a whole.\nHealth Insurance Goals\nAll payment methods create incentives for providers that a \ufb00 ect their behavior.

Can \nthey go to a private provider? Can they go directly to a hospital or specialist or do they \nneed to be referred by a primary care physician? This issue a \ufb00 ects bene \ufb01 ciary satisfac-\ntion (people prefer to choose their doctor) and medical costs (people tend to choose \nmore expensive levels of care if they are not paying for it directly). Greater provider choice may be possible if the insurer can contract private providers and contain costs. To encourage bene \ufb01 ciaries to use primary health care, many insurers require primary careproviders to serve as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who determine the medical necessity for referral to hospitals and specialists. \nWithin many countries, shortages of health workers and facilities present a di \ufb03  cult \nchallenge. Health care providers may not be available in all geographic areas, or may be \ndisproportionately located in urban areas with very few, if any, in rural areas. If no pro-\nviders are available, having health insurance is irrelevant. In other situations, the quality of providers may be so poor that people choose not to access services, so again, having health insurance could become irrelevant if the population is uninterested in using poor-quality services.

The contracting process works best when it re \ufb02 ects a partnership \ninstead of an adversarial relationship that requires legal protection. Insurers should state \ntheir policy goals for health insurance clearly and speci \ufb01 cally and ask providers how they \ncan supply services to meet these goals. Contracting is discussed further in Element 6. \nOperational and Information Constraints\nWhen engaging providers and choosing a provider payment method, it is important forOperational and Information Constraints\nWhen engaging providers and choosing a provider payment method, it is important for \npolicy makers to consider realistically the extent to which valid information is available on medical costs, utilization rates, case mix, and population and provider characteris-\ntics. Some payment methods require extensive information while others do not (table \n6.1). Other important considerations include the technical capacity of both the insurance entity (the payer) and the providers to use new forms, enforce \u200a/\u200acomply with new pro-6.1).

Some developing countries may not have the data, capacity, and time needed to design the optimal payment system. Therefore, it is prefer-able to \u201cstart simple\u201d so the insurer can avoid delays in providers\u2019 receipt of payments, since delays erode the trust and cooperation needed to work with providers over the long term. Finally, to be a \ufb00 ordable, payment and administration systems must have rea-\nsonable transaction costs and o \ufb00 er value for money.

Additionally, the Chinese government had a compensation policy for doc-tors that allowed them to earn a 15 percent to 25 percent markup on drugs prescribed. \nBoth the FFS provider payments and the drug markup policy created incentives that \nresulted in undesirable doctor practices such as overprescribing drugs, favoring more expensive drugs, and overproviding inappropriate services with higher pro \ufb01 tability \nmargins. In turn, these provider behaviors increased costs and reduced service quality.\nSince 2003, the Chinese government has been establishing the New Rural Coopera-margins. In turn, these provider behaviors increased costs and reduced service quality.\nSince 2003, the Chinese government has been establishing the New Rural Coopera-\ntive Medical Care System across rural China as a means to address the lack of health insurance. While this scheme provides heavy government subsidies for premiums and has achieved remarkable coverage for its rural population, it did not solve the problems inherent to FFS payment or the drug markup policies. \nIn 2003, a salary-plus-bonus payment method was introduced in Guizhou Prov-In 2003, a salary-plus-bonus payment method was introduced in Guizhou Prov-\nince through a subsidized CBHI experiment, Rural Mutual Health Care. The experiment concluded in 2006 with the analysis suggesting that in comparison with the traditional FFS payment method, a mixed payment method was able to reduce the cost of health services. The analysis of a household survey showed a 12 percent reduction in the cost of services at the village level after the payment change. The cost per visit at the vil-lage level declined by 20 percent, and the cost of drug prescriptions per visit declined by 25 percent. The drop occurred mainly among nonpoor-health patients, not among poor-health patients, implying provider payment change has more e \ufb00 ects on reducing \nunnecessary services rather than reducing medically necessary care. Guizhou Province showed that appropriate provider payment incentives could be used as a cost-control mechanism to improve the e \ufb03  ciency of resource utilization.Country Example: Synergy between PBF and CBHI in Rwanda\nThere are synergies in Rwanda between performance-based \ufb01 nancing (PBF) and the \nCBHI schemes (see Country Example in Element 2).19 In the PBF model for a health cen-\nter, performance payments are based on the quantity of outputs achieved conditional on \nthe quality of services delivered. The outputs are measured monthly, quality quarterly, \nthrough the use of an elaborate supervisory checklist. Health center sta \ufb00  can increase \ntheir performance, and hence their earnings, by increasing the quantity of outputs, the \nquality of services delivered, or both. When both quantity and quality increase, earnings are highest. \nThe increase in the number of health visits that result from the removal of \ufb01 nan-\ncial barriers by CBHI schemes boosts the quantitative indicators for PBF to the \ufb01 nancial \nbene \ufb01 t of the health facility and its sta \ufb00 , thus reducing the concerns of the la \u0134 er aboutcial barriers by CBHI schemes boosts the quantitative indicators for PBF to the \ufb01 nancial \nbene \ufb01 t of the health facility and its sta \ufb00 , thus reducing the concerns of the la \u0134 er about \nseeking money from curative care.

For in-\nstance, a private hospital or association of doctors might form an HMO that combines \nthe roles of insurer and provider. For example, UNIMED, an association of doctors founded in 1967 in Brazil, has grown into a network of 377 nonpro \ufb01 t physician coopera-\ntives throughout the country that provide HMO-style health insurance to 15 million in-dividuals and 73,000 companies. Each UNIMED cooperative has its own administration and competes in its geographic area with other private health insurers and providers. Uganda also has several provider-based insurance organizations.The \ufb01 nancial performance of a health insurance scheme is in \ufb02 uenced by the quality and \nmotivation of its managerial and administrative sta \ufb00 , in addition to the behavior of clinical \nproviders. The number of managerial and administrative sta \ufb00  needed will depend on:\n\u25a0 The overall size of the scheme in terms of population and geographic coverage. \nLarger schemes achieve economies of scale by spreading \ufb01 xed administrative \ncosts across more members.\n\u25a0 How the scheme is \ufb01 nanced (collecting premiums from the informal sector is \nmore labor intensive than collecting payroll taxes) and pays providers (paying individual claims is more labor intensive than paying salaries (Elements 2 and 5). \n\u25a0 The degree of automation and use of information technologies.\nGovernance within the Organizational Structure\nWithout good governance, e \ufb00 orts to expand health insurance could waste resources, de-\u25a0 The degree of automation and use of information technologies.\nGovernance within the Organizational Structure\nWithout good governance, e \ufb00 orts to expand health insurance could waste resources, de-\nstroy public trust, and fail to achieve policy objectives. Governance of health insurance can be de \ufb01 ned as accountable and transparent relationships between health insurance stake-\nholders, such as the government, the bene \ufb01 ciaries, payers, health care providers, and \nother insurers. Good governance within an insurance scheme can be achieved in the \nfollowing ways (Savedo \ufb00  and Go \u0134 ret 2008):\n\u25a0 Coherent decision-making structures . Decision makers are empowered with the au-\nthority, tools, and resources to ful \ufb01 ll their responsibilities; and face consequences \nfor their decisions. For instance, if the law makes insurance funds responsible for \ntheir own \ufb01 nancial sustainability, fund managers must have the authority, tools,for their decisions. For instance, if the law makes insurance funds responsible for \ntheir own \ufb01 nancial sustainability, fund managers must have the authority, tools, \nand resources to control costs by managing provider payments or the bene \ufb01 ts \npackage, or by increasing revenues by increasing the premium rate.\n\u25a0 Stakeholder participation. Stakeholder input can be incorporated into decision making \nand oversight. For example, the council that oversees the Ghana NHIA consists of \nstakeholders from the government, district o \ufb03  cials, private sector, and civil society. \n\u25a0 Transparency and information . Information should be accessible to decision makers \nand to the stakeholders who can hold decision makers accountable. For example, the private insurance regulator in Brazil publishes performance ratings for all private in-\nsurers on its Web site for consumers and providers to see. This has led one insurer tosurers on its Web site for consumers and providers to see. This has led one insurer to \npay its contracted hospitals to seek accreditation based on quality improvements.\n27 \n\u25a0 Supervision and regulation . Actors must be accountable for their actions and per-\nformance. This type of accountability involves consequences for poor perfor-\nmance. For example, in India, a state government paid an insurance company to", "62": "Health Insurance Handbook 47\nenroll the poor population for one year. However, the insurance company failed \nto educate bene \ufb01 ciaries about their rights to services, so there were few medical \nclaims for the entire year, allowing the insurance company to keep the premium \nrevenue as pure pro \ufb01 t. There was a failure of governance due to inadequate super-\nvision and a lack of incentives for the insurer to promote access and use of bene \ufb01 ts. \n\u25a0 Consistency and stability . An insurance scheme that is a stable institution behav-\ning consistently helps avoid uncertainty around rulemaking and processes over \ntime, and the potential disruptions of political change. This encourages longer-\nterm investments by providers and greater uptake by consumers. For example, \nprivate providers are more willing to invest in information technology to im-prove quality and e \ufb03  ciency if they are con \ufb01 dent that the payments they receive \nfrom the health insurance system will continue.from the health insurance system will continue. \nCountry Example: Many Health Insurance Models and \nDifferent Organizational Structures in India\nIndia is a good example of a country with many di \ufb00 erent models of health insurance, \neach with a di \ufb00 erent organizational structure.

Bene \ufb01 ciaries pay a \nnominal registration fee (Rs.30, or $0.63) per annum. Additional administrative costs not \ncovered by premiums are borne by the state government. \nThe administration of the scheme is generally outsourced by the selected insurer to \na TPA. The TPA authorizes hospitalizations and surgeries, processes claims, and main-\ntains a register of the members.

In many \nAfrican countries, means testing usually occurs at the point of service delivery and rare-ly before the need for health care arises. Wage and tax records are often unavailable or nonexistent in these countries. Facility administrators thus use their discretion to deter-mine who is unable to pay fees, resulting in informal means testing that relies on income proxies.

This section focuses on the operational sys-tems that will help ensure that the health insurance scheme runs smoothly and health \ninsurance objectives are achieved.insurance objectives are achieved. \nIn this context, operational systems  refers to the administrative and management sys-\ntems, functions, and processes that support the execution of health insurance. Once you \ndetermine the critical functions to help the insurance scheme operate (Element 6), it will be necessary to identify what capacity-building is needed so that the actors involved in the health insurance scheme are ready to carry out their new responsibilities. You may also have to plan to educate other stakeholders in your health system about the overarching manage-ment structure and operational issues. These steps may be a part of your action plan. \nFinancial Processes and Management \nFinancial management is critical to ensure adequacy of \ufb01 nancial resources to cover op-\nerating costs, keep the health insurance funds in \ufb01 nancial equilibrium, and ensure trans-\nparency for sound monitoring, management, and viability. This includes maintainingerating costs, keep the health insurance funds in \ufb01 nancial equilibrium, and ensure trans-\nparency for sound monitoring, management, and viability. This includes maintaining \nan adequate operating reserve to cover known costs, risks, and unforeseeable short-term \nrisks. When several stakeholders are involved in the implementation of health insurance and potentially multiple sources of income for the scheme (individuals, employers, and government), maintaining the management and integrity of these funds is vital to opti-mize e\ufb03  ciency and e \ufb00 ectiveness.", "66": "Health Insurance Handbook 51\nThe \ufb01 nancial management system should have the following three main elements: \n\u25a0 A budgeting system to plan for and understand all costs related to the health \ninsurance scheme\n\u25a0 An expenditure tracking system to ensure the proper internal controls to manage \nthe \ufb02 ow of funds\n\u25a0 A cost management system to ensure payments and costs are in line with what is budgeted for \ufb01 nancial viability.\nBUDGETING  SYSTEM  \nThe budgeting system  refers to the planning and budgeting of expenses related to the \nhealth insurance scheme. These expenses include administrative costs, marketing costs, legal costs, and claims or bene \ufb01 ts costs. During the planning phases of health insurance, \nall costs must be estimated and planned for to ensure that the revenues collected are \nadequate to meet the needs of the insurance scheme. \nIf the budget reveals a funding gap, the gap must be addressed. This can be doneadequate to meet the needs of the insurance scheme. \nIf the budget reveals a funding gap, the gap must be addressed. This can be done \nby revising the bene \ufb01 ts package, revising premium amounts, reducing administrative \ncosts, and \u200a/\u200aor taking other actions. These changes are not easy to make and often take \nconsiderable time to address because of contractual obligations and other variables. \nEXPENDITURE  TRACKING  SYSTEM  \nThe expenditure tracking system refers to the internal systems in place to manage the \n\ufb02 ow of funds. This includes robust accounting and cash-management systems, as well \nas internal controls to receive and document the \ufb02 ow of funds and accounts payable. \nA well-functioning expenditure tracking system is essential for monitoring the use of \nfunds, detecting fraud, and determining areas for cost containment. \nThe expenditure tracking system will also likely be the system that pools all incom-funds, detecting fraud, and determining areas for cost containment. \nThe expenditure tracking system will also likely be the system that pools all incom-\ning \ufb01 nancial resources and manages the use of the resources to \ufb01 nance the insurance \nscheme. For example, all resources collected from the bene \ufb01 ciaries, employers, and gov-\nernment will be pooled and tracked in the expenditure-tracking system. \nCOST MANAGEMENT  \nCost management  refers to the mechanisms by which a health insurance scheme can con-\ntrol the resources that are being spent. It is the feedback loop to ensure that expenses stay \nwithin the budgets forecasted. E \ufb00 ective cost management is critical to ensure the viabil-\nity of the health insurance scheme and includes utilization management, expenditure \ntracking and reporting, and \ufb01 nancial adjustments during implementation of the scheme. \nOnce a health insurance scheme is established, health care utilization rates willtracking and reporting, and \ufb01 nancial adjustments during implementation of the scheme. \nOnce a health insurance scheme is established, health care utilization rates will \nlikely increase because of moral hazard and the e \ufb00 ectively lower cost to health care con-\nsumers. Moral hazard is inevitable when a traditionally costly service for which there is unmet need becomes \ufb01 nancially accessible. It is very di \ufb03  cult to forecast the amount of \nmoral hazard a new health insurance scheme will experience. That is why it is critical to manage expenses after start-up and maintain the \ufb02 exibility to revise program ben-\ne\ufb01 ts and payment arrangements; adjustments will probably have to be made along the \nway to stay within budget. For example, a scheme may need to institute copayments or coinsurance to help generate revenue and limit utilization, or alter the mode in which providers are paid in order to discourage overprovision of services.", "67": "World Bank Working Paper 52\nWhile many stakeholders provide inputs into the \ufb01 nancial management system, it \nis important that the main managing entity of the scheme (the \u201cowner\u201d of the scheme) \nbe responsible for its overall \ufb01 nancial management, managing and controlling costs, and \nmaking necessary changes to maximize e \ufb03  ciency without compromising quality. When \nmultiple stakeholders are involved in the implementation of the insurance scheme, the \nmanaging entity must develop systems for collecting the relevant data on a timely basis. This includes \ufb01 nancial data (expenses for services, administration, human resources, \netc.), as well as claims and utilization data. \nContract Management \nOften, the entity managing the overall health insurance program does not have the skills \nor capacity to accommodate all health insurance functions.

In other circumstances, the government may contract with private pro-\nviders to deliver covered health services, expanding consumers\u2019 choice of providers and possibly increasing the quality of available care. A group of doctors or a hospital may contract with an insurance company or managed care organization to manage the costs of health care services. \nThe managing entity may not always be the contract holder.

Regardless of who the contracting parties are, e \ufb00 ectively wri \u0134 en contracts must always specify mechanisms to \nensure compliance. Contract language should be laid out not just to identify the func-tional responsibilities that are being transferred, but to also lay out regulations by which the contractor must abide. This will ensure that other stakeholders, particularly bene \ufb01 -\nciaries, are protected. \nTo illustrate, take the example of a government that decides to contract with an \ninsurance company to enroll bene \ufb01 ciaries and manage \ufb01 nancial risk. The entity writing \nand managing the contract would want to ensure that the contract includes clear and enforceable guidelines de \ufb01 ning:", "68": "Health Insurance Handbook 53\n\u25a0 Eligibility (who can participate) \n\u25a0 Enrolment (speci \ufb01 c guidelines for enrolling, documentation needed from ben-\ne\ufb01 ciary for enrolment, contribution requirements, pre-existing condition exclu-\nsions, etc., as well as parameters to ensure the insurance company is not simply \nenrolling the healthiest individuals and deeming the sick ineligible) \n\u25a0 How the insurance policy can be marketed \n\u25a0 Claims payment (how quickly must the insurance company make payment on \na claim, pre-authorization requirements, processes to adjudicate the claim, etc.) \n\u25a0 Grievance redress (who will be responsible, how grievances will be handled, how quickly the grievance must be addressed, and so forth). \nAnother example involves providers.

For instance, iftracts with providers that holds the bene \ufb01 ciaries harmless in the event that a service \ncosts more than the agreed-upon reimbursement rate to the provider. For instance, if \nproviders are paid on a capitation or a case-management basis (DRG or other model), but the cost of delivering services to an individual patient exceeds the amount paid to the provider, the provider might expect the bene \ufb01 ciary to cover the extra cost. A \u201chold \nharmless\u201d provision prevents the provider from doing so, which can be very important from the bene \ufb01 ciary perspective and can help control total costs.\nContract management becomes increasingly important in more complex health in-\nsurance schemes.

They can be used to educate the population about the scheme to generate demand for enroll-ing (marketing).

For example, where health insurance schemes are \npredominantly private, the government may have an incentive to educate bene \ufb01 ciaries \nabout their rights under the schemes. Stakeholders responsible for enrolment may have an incentive to market the health insurance scheme to generate demand for enrolling. Marketing and communication become particularly important in a voluntary scheme if bene \ufb01 ciaries are expected to contribute to the premium. In that case generating demand \nand persuading people to join becomes a high priority.", "69": "World Bank Working Paper 54\nIt may be necessary to regulate marketing and communication strategies to ensure \nthat bene \ufb01 ciaries understand their rights and coverage. As mentioned in Element 6, a \nstate-led health insurance scheme in India was launched to cover all of the people liv-\ning below the poverty line. The state government fully subsidized the premium and contracted an insurance company to cover this population. However, the insurance com-pany was required to do very li \u0134 le marketing and communications. After one year of \nimplementation, there were few claims because bene \ufb01 ciaries did not know they were \ncovered by the health insurance program. \nSome countries have very strict guidelines for marketing insurance schemes.

Systems must be established to mini-\nmize the opportunity for fraud. \nAssessing eligibility for the insurance and any subsidies can be very challenging. If a \nsegment of the population receives subsidized coverage or the health insurance program is targeted to a speci \ufb01 c segment of the population, the enrolment agency needs to be able \nto distinguish between those who are eligible for the scheme or subsidy and those who are not. This is critical to the viability of the scheme, as it has great potential for fraud. \nVarious mechanisms have been developed to identify eligibility for bene \ufb01 ts, such as \nsubsidies for the poor, including means testing,\n28 direct targeting, characteristic target-\ning, waivers, and exemptions.

If the targeting mechanism is not strict enough, there is risk of leakage, with too many people receiving a bene \ufb01 t. \nIf the insurance scheme issues an insurance card to demonstrate membership, other \noperational considerations need to be made. How will the insurance card be linked to any veri \ufb01 able information about the bene \ufb01 ciary? How can fraud be minimized and the \nintegrity of the insurance card maintained?

How will insurance cards be printed andinsurance cards, to ensure accurate payments? How will insurance cards be printed and \ndistributed, particularly in resource-constrained se \u0134 ings? These are just some of the \nquestions that need to be addressed if an insurance card is used to verify membership \nin an insurance scheme.", "70": "Health Insurance Handbook 55\nCollection of Financial Contributions \nPremium collection  is the gathering of \ufb01 nancial contributions for participation in the \nhealth insurance scheme. It is a critical function that can be di \ufb03  cult to manage in low-\nresource se \u0134 ings. This issue was addressed to some extent in Element 2, which looked \nat \ufb01 nancing mechanisms. Depending on the insurance model being used, premium con-\ntributions can be collected through general taxes (sales, income, real estate, import \u200a/\u200aex-\nport, and other taxes), payroll deductions, or directly from individuals enrolling in the \nscheme. Tax-based and payroll-based insurance \ufb01 nancing depend on a reasonably well-\nfunctioning tax system and a substantial formal sector that is willing to contribute. \nIn countries with a small formal sector (few registered companies) or e \ufb00 ective tax \nsystem, contributions must be collected directly from bene \ufb01 ciaries.

Reaching bene \ufb01 cia-\nries in dispersed, rural areas presents logistical challenges. For example, this is done door-to-door in rural Rwanda. Many subsistence farmers have cash income only in cer-\ntain seasons and will not be able to contribute except around harvest time. Families \nliving close to health facilities are far more likely to be willing to pay than those living farther away, although the most remote inhabitants often have the greatest need for health care services. \nTypically, it makes sense to collect \ufb01 nancial contributions at the same time as en-\nrolment. It may be administratively easier and more cost-e \ufb00 ective to collect annuallyTypically, it makes sense to collect \ufb01 nancial contributions at the same time as en-\nrolment. It may be administratively easier and more cost-e \ufb00 ective to collect annually \nfor a one-year subscription to the health insurance scheme, and this may work well in farming communities if contributions can be collected at harvest times when families are most likely to have cash. However, in many resource-poor communities, paying for a year of health insurance in one lump sum may be cost-prohibitive and discourage fami-lies from enrolling. Some countries have been able to link health insurance collections to micro \ufb01 nance organizations, allowing families to access credit to cover their health \ninsurance contributions and manage smaller payments on a regular basis. The fact that there is already a mechanism in place for debt payments facilitates this process. Overall, strong communications plans are critical to ensure that the population fully understands what they are paying for.Claims Administration \nClaims administration  refers to the process of receiving, reviewing, adjudicating, and pay-\ning claims. In many health insurance schemes, the payer is not in a position to manage \nthe claims process, so it is essential that another entity is hired to administer the claims \n(as addressed above under contract management). Claims administration also varies un-\nder di\ufb00 erent insurance models and provider payment systems. \nIn insurance schemes in which claims have to be processed, the responsibility for \n\ufb01 ling claims can fall on either the patient or the provider. In a cashless system, the ben-\ne\ufb01 ciary receives a covered service from a provider and does not pay the provider (other \nthan a possible copayment or for items that the scheme does not cover). The provider then submits a claim for that service to the claims administrator for payment. In a re-imbursable arrangement, the bene \ufb01 ciary seeks services and pays the provider out-of-pocket. The bene \ufb01 ciary then submits the receipt(s) and a claim for that payment to the \nclaims administrator for reimbursement.", "71": "World Bank Working Paper 56\nBene \ufb01 ciaries generally prefer the former (cashless) option because the reimburse-\nment option does not remove the \ufb01 nancial barrier to accessing care and requires care-\nful tracking of paperwork. Providers prefer the reimbursable arrangement because it \nreduces their administrative burden and allows them to be paid immediately (instead of waiting for reimbursement from a third party, which can take time). However, reim-bursement is much less feasible in resource-constrained se \u0134 ings where the ability to pay \nup front and submit a claim to an insurer may present logistical challenges. Weighing \nthe advantages and disadvantages of each option is essential to deciding on and devel-oping your insurance scheme design. \nWhichever submission option is selected, the claims administrator must determineWhichever submission option is selected, the claims administrator must determine \nif the claim is an eligible expense under the health insurance policy. This is an area of potential fraudulent behavior. Therefore, the claims administrator must have clear guidelines on which claims are allowable. Further, the claims administrator often needs to employ physicians or health care professionals to determine if a service was medically necessary and identify mutually exclusive claims. For example, a claim submi \u0134 ed for \npayment for both a normal, institutional delivery and for post-abortion care for the same individual should raise a red \ufb02 ag, because one person does not need both services for the \npregnancy. The claims administrator must investigate to ensure that the right claim was submi\u0134 ed and that fraudulent activity did not occur. Claims investigation is the process \nof obtaining all the information necessary to determine the appropriate amount to pay on a given claim.of obtaining all the information necessary to determine the appropriate amount to pay on a given claim. \nDepending on the insurance model, the payer and providers generally agree upon a \nrate schedule . This is the set of fees determined by an insurer or payer to be acceptable for \na procedure or service, which the physician agrees to accept as payment in full (this takes \ninto consideration any copayments, coinsurance, or deductible that may be applied). \nSometimes the rate schedule includes individual rates per each service. In other cases, there are \ufb01 xed, packaged (or case-based) payment rates (such as DRGs) that \u201cpre pack-\nage\u201d services. For example, for a woman delivering by cesarean section, the \ufb01 xed package \nrate includes all the services needed to perform that procedure (blood, surgery, anesthesia and other drugs, etc.). Packaged payments require more sophisticated actuarial, account-ing, and payment systems but are often preferred for cost-containment purposes.To minimize the number of claims that must be investigated, some insurers require \npre-authorization for each service. The provider must solicit the insurer\u2019s authorization to deliver the service to a bene \ufb01 ciary and will be guaranteed payment, assuming no \nother questions arise.\n29 \nFurther, to facilitate claims administration, it is necessary to establish a coding sys-\ntem by which the provider labels health care services with a numerical identi \ufb01 er that \nthat will be recognized by the payer or insurer. There are many di \ufb00 erent coding systems. \nRegardless of the system chosen, providers need training in \ufb01 lling out the claims paper-\nwork to ensure accuracy and e \ufb03  ciency. \nInformation Systems and Monitoring \nContinuous monitoring of insurance scheme performance against planned tasks is a key \nresponsibility of the managing entity. Monitoring is critical to every design element dis-cussed above.\n30 It must be undertaken routinely throughout the life of the scheme.

The MIS consists of a series of tools, \nprocedures, and information \ufb02 ows and can be either manual or electronic depending \non the technology available at di \ufb00 erent levels of the scheme. Some schemes use existing \nsoftware programs to manage data at both local and central levels. In other schemes, data collection at the local level is done on paper, and the data then must be entered into a software program at the central level. Ideally, one centralized, electronic information system will collect and monitor data from all levels, but this may not be feasible in all se\u0134 ings.The basic MIS administrative and technical monitoring tools and procedures are as \nfollows:\n\u25a0 Enrolment and \ufb01 nancial contribution data\n\u25a0 Coordination of bene \ufb01 ts and claims\n\u25a0 Financial monitoring.\nA membership database is needed to record information about members and de-\npendents and the payments they have made.

Other important information, such as bene \ufb01 ciary address, relation-\nship to the household head, and occupation of each bene \ufb01 ciary should be collected and \nentered in the membership database. Accurate premium payment information should be recorded and made rapidly available to providers. Some basic monitoring tools and documents used in enrolment monitoring are as follows:\n\u25a0 Membership card listing dates of coverage\n\u25a0 Up-to-date registers of members\n\u25a0 Up-to-date registers of premium payment\n\u25a0 Renewal information.\u25a0 Membership card listing dates of coverage\n\u25a0 Up-to-date registers of members\n\u25a0 Up-to-date registers of premium payment\n\u25a0 Renewal information.\nCOORDINATION  OF BENEFITS  AND MONITORING  CLAIMS\nAn MIS that monitors the claims administration process will ensure accurate and timely \npayment of claims.

Evaluation results are also im-portant for determining whether the most cost-e \ufb00 ective approaches are being used.\nPolicy makers should consider from the outset how to evaluate the impact and cost-\ne\ufb00 ectiveness of any proposed insurance scheme. Introducing the scheme in a way that \nfacilitates evaluation will ensure more rapidly available, robust, compelling, and policy-relevant results. This can be done, for instance, by piloting the scheme in a randomly \nselected set of districts that have been matched to control districts\u2014if a universal in-\nsurance scheme is introduced, it is much more di \ufb03  cult to design a robust evaluation \nretroactively.

The key di\ufb00 erence in this approach is the lack of random assignment. \n\u25a0 Pre-post evaluation design is often used in project evaluation.

Health Insurance and Priority \nServices: How Do We Make It Work? \nIncreasing access to and use of priority1 and preventive health care services is critical to \nimprove health outcomes and reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For \nexample, high fertility leads to increased risk of maternal mortality and poverty, and \nhigh maternal mortality leads to increased risk of infant mortality. In most countries, \nthere is a political desire to improve access to and use of priority services to reduce fertil-ity, improve maternal health outcomes, and improve child health outcomes. Financing these priority and preventive health care services, however, often proves di \ufb03  cult be-\ncause of the limited tax revenues, ine \ufb03  cient use of funds, and poverty. \nNational Health Accounts (NHA) data show that household out-of-pocket spend-cause of the limited tax revenues, ine \ufb03  cient use of funds, and poverty. \nNational Health Accounts (NHA) data show that household out-of-pocket spend-\ning for priority services is much higher than governments or donors realize. Though not the only factor that in \ufb02 uences the use of these essential services, the cost of health care, \nparticularly out-of-pocket expenses, does constitute a signi \ufb01 cant barrier to accessing the \nservices, particularly among the poor. This barrier then a \ufb00 ects the demand for and use \nof services. High out-of-pocket expenses also make people \ufb01 nancially vulnerable to cata-\nstrophic events and increasing poverty.\nHealth insurance mechanisms pool risks for health care costs and have the potentialstrophic events and increasing poverty.\nHealth insurance mechanisms pool risks for health care costs and have the potential \nto reduce or eliminate point-of-service costs. They are increasingly being created and expanded in developing countries to help achieve a variety of objectives. Some countries implement health insurance to reduce the risk of people\u2019s falling into poverty from high out-of-pocket health care costs. Others want to protect and improve health by increasing use of services, including priority services. \nThe purpose of this brief is to discuss the concepts of health insurance, the practice \nof designing and implementing health insurance, and whether priority services \u201c \ufb01 t\u201d \nwithin a health insurance scheme.

In other words, \ncertain health events that are unknown and generate unpredictable expenditure are the \nbest \ufb01 t as insurance-targeted goods and services and qualify as \u201cinsurable risks\u201d and arecertain health events that are unknown and generate unpredictable expenditure are the \nbest \ufb01 t as insurance-targeted goods and services and qualify as \u201cinsurable risks\u201d and are \n1.

This is an important consideration, as many countries in-troduce health insurance not only to reduce the risk of catastrophic health care costs, but also to improve population health through increasing use of health care services across \nthe board, including priority health care services. \nShould Priority Services Be Insured? \nGiven the above, what does this mean for priority health care services, such as reproduc-\ntive, maternal, and child health? Technically speaking and according to the de \ufb01 nition, \nmost priority health care services (such as family planning, prenatal care, and immu-\nnizations) do not \ufb01 t under the pure de \ufb01 nition of health insurance mainly due to their \npredictability. \nHowever, for many countries, the objective of establishing health insurance in-nizations) do not \ufb01 t under the pure de \ufb01 nition of health insurance mainly due to their \npredictability. \nHowever, for many countries, the objective of establishing health insurance in-\ncludes protecting health and reducing the risk of requiring catastrophic, inpatient care. \nTo achieve these objectives, it may necessary to consider including these \u201cnoninsurable\u201d services within the bene \ufb01 ts package. While many people refer to an expanded bene \ufb01 ts \npackage that includes known, frequent, low-cost services as health insurance, it is in fact a form of \u201cprepayment\u201d scheme. Prepayment schemes have bene \ufb01 ts packages that \ninclude what is traditionally considered noninsurable services, such as priority services. \nPrepayment schemes may also include an insurance portion, which covers catastrophic, \ninsurable risks. Many people use the term \u201chealth insurance\u201d to refer to both true health insurance schemes and prepayment schemes.insurable risks. Many people use the term \u201chealth insurance\u201d to refer to both true health insurance schemes and prepayment schemes. \nIf priority services are included, careful consideration to some key issues is re-\nquired.\n2 The determination of a bene \ufb01 ts package will depend on the structure of rev-\nenues (sources of funds), payment mechanisms (e.g., capitation, fee schedules), and de-\nlivery structure (e.g., gatekeepers, primary care groups, utilization review) that may be \nimplemented as part of the insurance scheme. All of these characteristics a \ufb00 ect the cost \nof the expanded bene \ufb01 ts package, as well as the feasibility and ease with which the ex-\npanded bene \ufb01 ts package can be executed. \n2.

Many schemes are in fact social security schemes, or simply pre-\npayment schemes. They may have an \u201cinsurance\u201d component to them, which pools risks to cover \nunpredicted health costs. Further, it is possible to create a bene \ufb01 ts package that is purely primary \nhealth care, to include preventive care. The drawback to this approach is that it does not serve the \nbasic function of health insurance, to protect individuals from unexpected, unpredictable high costs associated with disease or injury by spreading the risk for those costs across a large group of \nindividuals.", "88": "Health Insurance Handbook 73\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to including priority services in the bene-\n\ufb01 ts package. Operationally, it is much more di \ufb03  cult to include low-cost, high-frequency \nservices since these will require a more extensive review and billing process, a much \nmore frequent information exchange, and much higher administrative costs. There-fore, expanding a bene \ufb01 ts package to include priority services may require a phased \napproach to ensure that the system operationally can handle the increased capacity. As \nthe operation of insurance becomes more e \ufb03  cient and the sources of funding are more \nclosely aligned with the expected system costs, a more generous bene \ufb01 ts package may \nbecome possible. \nDespite some of these operational considerations, there are many reasons to believeclosely aligned with the expected system costs, a more generous bene \ufb01 ts package may \nbecome possible. \nDespite some of these operational considerations, there are many reasons to believe \na relationship exists between health insurance enrolment and the use of priority health care services. The \ufb01 rst is that health insurance can increase the service use. Health insur-\nance can reduce \ufb01 nancial barriers to accessing health care services because it reduces the \npoint-of-service costs, which are often too high for individuals to cover when needed. Long-term methods of family planning, considered priority services, have high up-front costs, which can limit access to care (Stover and Heaton 1999). Because insurance is a prepayment scheme\n3 that reduces or eliminates costs at the time of service, people are \nmore inclined to utilize health services than they would be if they had to pay at the time \nof care (Eklund and Stavem 1990; Schneider, Diop, and Bucyana 2000).more inclined to utilize health services than they would be if they had to pay at the time \nof care (Eklund and Stavem 1990; Schneider, Diop, and Bucyana 2000).\nSecond, health insurance can make services more available. If priority services are \nnot covered by the insurance scheme, and the individual is less willing and less able to \npay, providers will be less willing to provide these priority services. Insurance plans have the potential to assist governments and donors in organizing the funds, purchasing these services from providers, and ensuring the quality of services. Because the insurance scheme pays for these services, they will be more available to the enrolled population. \nThird, if preventive measures are taken (as is the case with priority health care ser-\nvices), the long-term costs of health care should go down. For example, if a woman can prevent an unplanned pregnancy\u2014and thus avoid the cost of abortion, the costs ofvices), the long-term costs of health care should go down. For example, if a woman can prevent an unplanned pregnancy\u2014and thus avoid the cost of abortion, the costs of \ndelivery, the infant and child costs, and the longer term societal costs\u2014the overall cost \ncould go down. Further, if antenatal care is provided to pregnant women, the risks and costs associated with complicated delivery and emergency care are greatly reduced. \nThere are many reasons to justify the inclusion of priority services in a bene \ufb01 ts pack-\nage. Many countries have incorporated priority services in the bene \ufb01 ts package and have \nvaluable lessons that can be shared with others that are going down that path as well. \nExperiences of Including Priority Health Services in Bene \ufb01 ts Package\nThe case studies below present experiences from countries that have incorporated pri-\nority health care services in their health insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment bene \ufb01 ts package.

There were some exemptions to the user fees, but experi-\nence showed that user fees substantially decreased access to health care services, partic-\nularly among the poor. Evaluations determined that the exemptions were being applied \nunevenly and that the poor still faced \ufb01 nancial barriers to obtaining needed services. \nTo help overcome the \ufb01 nancial barriers, community-based health insurance pro-\ngrams (CBHI) began appearing throughout the country and increased substantially be-tween 2001 and 2003 (47 CBHI programs in 2001 and 168 in 2003). While CBHIs covered only about 1 percent of the population in 2003, it was clear there was a need and demand for a formal health- \ufb01 nancing mechanism to spread the costs of health care across a group \nof people. \nThis demand prompted the government to explore abolishing user fees and im-of people. \nThis demand prompted the government to explore abolishing user fees and im-\nplementing a national health insurance scheme. In 2003, the government began intro-ducing policies to exempt women from delivery fees in public, private, and mission facilities. Along with this change, the government passed the National Health Insurance Act, which aimed to provide universal coverage to all Ghanaians within \ufb01 ve years. The \nscheme was to be nationally mandated in all districts. By 2007, approximately 42 percent of the population was covered by the insurance scheme. \nBENEFITS  PACKAGE  \nThe National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) now covers basic health care services, \nincluding outpatient consultations, essential drugs, inpatient care and shared accommo-dation, maternity care (normal and cesarean), eye care, dental care, and emergency care. \nInitially, certain public health services were excluded from the bene \ufb01 ts packageInitially, certain public health services were excluded from the bene \ufb01 ts package \nbecause they were considered \u201cessential public goods\u201d and were provided free by the \ngovernment.

A cost-bene \ufb01 t study found that, if family \nplanning were covered in 2009, by 2011 NHIS would save almost $11 million that year \nalone and up to $17 million by 2017 (cost savings would come from decreased fertility, averted births, and lower costs associated with birth [Smith and Fairbanks 2008]). \nOUTCOMES\u200a/\u200aIMPACT\nAn evaluation of NHIS was done in two of the districts, Nkoranza and O \ufb03  nso.5 It was \nfound that the proportion of women with delivery in the past 12 months who were \ninsured at time of delivery increased from 30 percent in 2004 (baseline) to 45 percent in \n2007.

Further analysis found that women of reproductive age from wealthier households enrolled in NHIS at higher rates than did women from poorer households: 16 percent of women from the poorest quintile were enrolled, compared with 48 percent of women from the richest quintile. \nDespite a expanded enrolment in the scheme, the analysis showed no signi \ufb01 cant \nchange in the proportion of women receiving prenatal care between baseline and end-line, indicating that NHIS did not increase use of prenatal care.

Also the distribution of deliveries that took place in the private, public, or mission facilities did not change. \nAlthough reducing \ufb01 nancial barriers to care through the NHIS does not appear to \nhave had an impact on the use of maternity care in this case, it was found that, since the initiation of NHIS, out-of-pocket expenditures decreased by approximately one-third, a signi \ufb01 cant change in household expenditures. Further, average expenditures on prenatalcare also declined (not statistically signi \ufb01 cant). Also, the proportion of women who did \nnot have to pay anything for their prenatal care increased from 8 percent to 43 percent. \nColombia \nThe government of Colombia transformed its health care system in 1993 with the enact-\nment of a law that provided for a transition from a supply-based health care model to a managed care insurance model.

For ex-ample, in Nigeria, a project funded by USAID formed a strategy to expand and improve the delivery of family planning and reproductive health products and services in the private health sector. The introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) presented an opportunity to address the needs of private providers participating in the scheme and to encourage them to promote the use of family planning and other priority services included in the scheme. The NHIS used a preferred provider model, in which bene \ufb01 ciaries choose their primary care providers who receive a \ufb01 xed monthly capitationfee for basic services. This gives providers an incentive to keep their patients healthy and to manage their costs e \ufb00 ectively.\nBox A.1. Including Priority Services in Health Insurance: The Case of Family \nPlanning\nGlobally, an estimated 210 million pregnancies occur each year. Of these, 60 million end in abortion or with the death of the mother or baby. More than 500,000 maternal deaths and 4 million neonatal deaths occur annually. More than 54 million women suffer diseases or \ncomplications due to pregnancy and childbirth. The need for family planning (FP) is of great \nimportance, but it is not being met around the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 19.4 percent of women would like to avoid becoming pregnant but are not using contraception (Levine et al. 2006). \nGiven these staggering statistics, it is important to increase access to and use of FP services. \nOne way is through health insurance \u200a\u200a/\u200a\u200aprepayment mechanisms.Given these staggering statistics, it is important to increase access to and use of FP services. \nOne way is through health insurance \u200a\u200a/\u200a\u200aprepayment mechanisms. \nWhy include FP in insurance bene \ufb01 ts package? It makes sense for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Cost-effectiveness.  FP is cost-effective (Levine et al. 2006; Stover, et al. 1996;  Mauldin \nand Miller 1994;  Pritchett 1994; Hughes and McGuire 1996). An averted pregnancy can \nprevent health care costs associated with other conditions or ailments. Inclusion of FP in insurance is important from a cost perspective because averting a birth also reduces future fertility, and DALYs saved can exceed the gains possible from the health bene \ufb01 ts to just \none generation. \n(Box continues on next page)", "95": "World Bank Working Paper 80\nCost-Bene \ufb01 t Analysis of Family \nPlanning\nBanking on Healtha conducted a cost-ben-\ne\ufb01 t analysis of adding coverage of long-\nterm and permanent FP methods and in-\njectable contraceptives to the Ghana NHIS \nbene \ufb01 ts package.

The high rate of \nunmet need for FP is a red \ufb02 ag that bar-\nriers to FP access exist. Inclusion of FP, a desired product, could increase the at-tractiveness of health insurance, making the insurance scheme more feasible to implement and sustain.\n\u2022 Promotion of merit good . Although FP services are consumed by private individuals, the\u2022 Promotion of merit good . Although FP services are consumed by private individuals, the \nservices have profound externalities (external bene \ufb01 ts and\u200a\u200a/\u200a\u200aor costs) and are therefore \noften considered merit goods. These are the health needs de \ufb01 ned by the experts and so-\nciety that everyone should have regardless of willingness and ability to pay. Putting these types of services into a health insurance bene \ufb01 ts package can ensure their availability and \npromote their use. \n\u2022 Ef \ufb01 ciency of delivery . If the FP services are included in the health insurance package, they \ncan be organized and delivered through the existing health insurance provider networks, which will make the service delivery more ef \ufb01 cient. \nSpeci \ufb01 c Complexities of Including FP in Health Insurance\n\u2022 Politics.  The politics of FP has been contentious for decades; this has affected its sus-\ntainability and funding. Health insurance is not immune to FP politics. Prioritizing services\u2022 Politics.  The politics of FP has been contentious for decades; this has affected its sus-\ntainability and funding. Health insurance is not immune to FP politics. Prioritizing services \nto be included in health insurance can come under great scrutiny, which opens the door for political adversaries to voice opinions of whether to include (and promote) FP through health insurance. \n\u2022 Funding gaps . Because FP is considered a merit good, which is often de \ufb01 ned by need \nrather than by demand, consumers\u2019 willingness to pay may not be suf \ufb01 cient to cover the \nservices de \ufb01 ned in the bene \ufb01 ts package. If insurance relies on the premium contribution \nfrom the enrollee, funding gaps may stand in the way of including FP. Further, many coun-tries omit FP as a bene \ufb01 t in health insurance, indicating that the public health care systemfrom the enrollee, funding gaps may stand in the way of including FP. Further, many coun-tries omit FP as a bene \ufb01 t in health insurance, indicating that the public health care system \nwill provide it free of charge to all in need. For example, in Ghana, FP was determined to be an \u201cessential public good\u201d and would be offered \u201cfree\u201d through the Ghana Health Service. However, because constrained budgets failed to cover all basic operational costs at facil-ity level, almost every public facility and all private facilities charged fees for FP products (PSP-One 2008).\n\u2022 Opportunities to include FP in health insurance bene \ufb01 ts packages . Despite the dif \ufb01 culties, \nthere are very important reasons to include FP in health insurance bene \ufb01 ts packages. Be-\nlow we present a few ways in which stakeholders can help get FP covered: \n(Box continues on next page)", "96": "Health Insurance Handbook 81\nInformation Dissemination \u200a/\u200aOutreach\nInformation dissemination and outreach is a critical component of successful health in-\nsurance\u200a/\u200aprepayment. While this is true for all health insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment models and \nbene \ufb01 ts packages, it is particularly important when the packages include priority health \ncare services, as one of the objectives is to increase use of priority services. Bene \ufb01 ciaries \nmust understand what services their health insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment scheme covers and \nwhere they can obtain them. They must also understand the fee structure in before using \nthe services (e.g., if there is a copayment). \nE\ufb00 ective information dissemination also allows the scheme to expand and a \u0134 ractthe services (e.g., if there is a copayment). \nE\ufb00 ective information dissemination also allows the scheme to expand and a \u0134 ract \nnew members, which creates a large pool of persons among whom to spread the costs and risks. For example, in Peru, a USAID-funded project called Apoyo a Programas de Poblaci\u00f3n was implemented to expand family planning programs in the private sector and increase the number of insurance companies and employers o \ufb00 ering family plan-\nning services. The project was unsuccessful in a \u0134 racting new users to the insurance \nscheme primarily because of ine \ufb00 ective communication and information dissemination \npractices. Therefore the e \ufb00 ect of health insurance coverage on family planning use could \nnot be determined (Lambert et al. 1994). \nContent of Bene \ufb01 ts Package\nThere is no gold standard when it comes to developing a health insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment \nbene \ufb01 ts package; however, what is known is that the bene \ufb01 ts package must meet theThere is no gold standard when it comes to developing a health insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment \nbene \ufb01 ts package; however, what is known is that the bene \ufb01 ts package must meet the \npeople\u2019s needs to be perceived as useful. This is particularly true when bene \ufb01 ciaries are \nexpected to contribute to the scheme. Box A.1 (continued)\n\u2022 Service bundling . FP does not have to be a stand-alone service that is provided to all ben-\ne\ufb01 ciaries. For example, to alleviate some of the political challenges that can surface, some \ncountries have bundled FP services into other packages of services, such as postpartum \nservices. Preventing pregnancy immediately following birth is an important public health \nconsideration that generally has public and medical support. Counseling women at this time about the use of FP can be an effective way to include FP in the bene \ufb01 ts package. \n\u2022 Advocacy .

Generating demand for FP coverage can be one of the most effective ways to \nget FP covered by health insurance. Depending on the model of health insurance, differ-\nent stakeholders may be involved in determining the bene \ufb01 ts package so it is important to \ntarget messages to the appropriate audience (e.g., Ministry of Health, employers, insurance agency). \n\u2022 Funding guideline . In decentralized settings, resource decisions belong to local govern-\nments, which can result in FP not being adequately addressed. In Bolivia, where decision \nmaking has been decentralized to 311 municipalities, the central government has devel-\noped guidelines to ensure that funds are allocated in accordance with national priorities. Based on these guidelines, for example, local governments have to allocate a speci \ufb01 c per-\ncentage of revenue to the universal health insurance program for mothers and children. Without such guidance, programs such as FP might be underfunded.\nbcentage of revenue to the universal health insurance program for mothers and children.

If bene \ufb01 ciaries, particularly the poor, do \nnot see a value added to participating in a scheme, people are likely to drop out of the \nscheme and not renew their membership. This may be the case with a bene \ufb01 ts package \nthat covers only catastrophic care, as the chance of experiencing a catastrophic health \ncondition is rare. In contrast, a bene \ufb01 ts package that provides coverage for services that \nbene \ufb01 ciaries often need provides a greater incentive to renew membership. \nDiscontinuing health insurance membership can put considerable strain on a \nhealth insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment scheme\u2019s viability, so maximizing renewal rates is a seri-\nous consideration. Ensuring the bene \ufb01 ts package includes services that are demanded \nand needed by the bene \ufb01 ciary population will help them realize the value-added of theous consideration.

If the quality of services provided \nby the insurance scheme is poor, bene \ufb01 ciaries will not use them, regardless of whether \nthey are free or not. This is evidenced by the fact that even in systems where services are provided free of charge in public facilities, the poor often pay for services in the private sector to obtain superior quality. \nQuality depends on many variables\u2014too many to address all of them here. A criti-Quality depends on many variables\u2014too many to address all of them here. A criti-\ncal variable, however, is the provider\u2019s ability to take on the demand for services, both in number and in type. For example, if an insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment bene \ufb01 ts package is \nexpanded to include clinical methods of family planning, but the local participating pro-vider does not have the ability to deliver these services, including that service in the insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment package is not e \ufb00 ective.

Further, commodity security would need to be strength-ened to ensure that supplies meet the new demand. Jumping too quickly into including family planning in Ghana, might compromise service quality. E \ufb00 ective planning to en-\nsure that providers have the capacity necessary to meet the increased demand and that supplies are available would help Ghana make the transition to include this important service.\nFacilitating Delivery of Drugs and Consumables at Provider Level \nIt is necessary to have a national and local supply system that allows health personnel \nto get the drugs and consumables needed to deliver the priority services, such as com-modities for family planning and obstetric and neonatal emergencies. If a participatingto get the drugs and consumables needed to deliver the priority services, such as com-modities for family planning and obstetric and neonatal emergencies. If a participating \nprovider does not have access to commodities needed to deliver services included in the \nbene \ufb01 ts package, there is no bene \ufb01 t from including them. Most countries struggle with \ndelivering commodities and supplies to all providers, particularly those in more remote locations. Stock-outs and other logistical challenges could compromise the expansion of service use that would have been observed otherwise.", "98": "Health Insurance Handbook 83\nAvailability of Free Services in Public Facilities through Donor Funds\nExpanding health insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment bene \ufb01 ts can sometimes be costly, given all the \nadministrative duties necessary to manage a successful insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment scheme. \nWhile the cost of including new, low-cost services is nominal, the costs to ensure that the \nsystem can respond to the added service (such as logistics supply and provider capac-\nity) might not outweigh the bene \ufb01 ts. This is especially true when donors \ufb01 nance priority \nservices provision free of charge or at a very low cost, such as is the case with family planning services. \nFurther, a country where many priority services are o \ufb00 ered free of charge may see \nonly a marginal increase in use of services through the insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment scheme. \nThis is not to suggest that in situations where donor support is signi \ufb01 cant for the provi-only a marginal increase in use of services through the insurance \u200a/\u200aprepayment scheme. \nThis is not to suggest that in situations where donor support is signi \ufb01 cant for the provi-\nsion of priority services that the country does not \ufb01 nd alternative means to \ufb01 nance prior-\nity services.

These may include Ministries of Health, Departments of Planning, Ministries of Finance, agencies that oversee or regulate health facilities and insurance companies, public health specialists, health care providers, civil society representatives, private sector entities, and health insurance agencies.

This is the first Budget in Amrit \nKaal . \nIntroduction \n1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \nBudget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous \nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \nScheduled Tribes.  \n2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \nIndian economy as a \u2018bright star\u2019. Our current year\u2019s economic growth is \nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \nappreciates India\u2019s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \nwho had fought for India\u2019s independence, will with joy, bless us our \nendeavors going forward. \nResilience amidst multiple crises \n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India\u2019s rising global", "5": "2 \n \n \n profile is because of several accomplishments: unique world class digital \npublic infrastructure, e.g., Aadhaar, Co-Win and UPI; Covid vaccination drive \nin unparalleled scale and speed; proactive role in frontier areas such as \nachieving the climate related goals, mission LiFE, and National Hydrogen \nMission.  \n5. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \nGovernment. \nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \nunique opportunity to strengthen India\u2019s role in the world economic order. \nWith the theme of \u2018 Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u2019 , we are steering an \nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \n7.

This will facilitate \nefficient flow of credit, promote financial inclusion, and foster financial \nstability. A new legislative framework will govern this credit public \ninfrastructure, and it will be designed in consultation with the RBI. \nFinancial Sector Regulations  \n99. To meet the needs of Amrit Kaal  and to facilitate optimum \nregulation in the financial sector, public consultation, as necessary and \nfeasible, will be brought to the process of regulation-making and issuing \nsubsidiary directions. \n100. To simplify, ease and reduce cost of compliance, financial sector \nregulators will be requested to carry out a comprehensive review of existing \nregulations. For this, they will consider suggestions from public and \nregulated entities. Time limits to decide the applications under various \nregulations will also be laid down. \nGIFT IFSC  \n101. To enhance business activities in GIFT IFSC, the following measures \nwill be taken: \n\uf0b7 Delegating powers under the SEZ Act to IFSCA to avoid dual \nregulation, \n\uf0b7 Setting up a single window IT system for registration and \napproval from IFSCA, SEZ authorities, GSTN, RBI, SEBI and \nIRDAI,  ", "26": "23 \n \n \n \uf0b7 Permitting acquisition financing by IFSC Banking Units of \nforeign banks,  \n\uf0b7 Establishing a subsidiary of EXIM Bank for trade  \nre-financing, \n\uf0b7 Amending IFSCA Act for statutory provisions for arbitration, \nancillary services, and avoiding dual regulation under SEZ Act, \nand \n\uf0b7 Recognizing offshore derivative instruments as valid contracts.  \n \nData Embassy \n102.

For investors to reclaim unclaimed shares and unpaid dividends \nfrom the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority with ease, an \nintegrated IT portal will be established. \nDigital Payments  \n107. Digital payments continue to find wide acceptance. In 2022, they \nshow increase of 76 per cent in transactions  \nand 91 per cent in value. Fiscal support for this digital public infrastructure \nwill continue in 2023-24.  \nAzadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav Mahila Samman Bachat Patra  \n108. For commemorating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, a one-time new small \nsavings scheme, Mahila Samman Savings Certificate, will be made available \nfor a two-year period up to March 2025. This will offer deposit facility upto \n` 2 lakh in the name of women or girls for a tenor of 2 years at fixed \ninterest rate of 7.5 per cent with partial withdrawal option.  \nSenior Citizens  \n109.

The entire fifty-year loan to states has to be spent on capital \nexpenditure within 2023-24. Most of this will be at the discretion of states, \nbut a part will be conditional on states increasing their actual capital", "28": "25 \n \n \n expenditure. Parts of the outlay will also be linked to, or allocated for, the \nfollowing purposes: \n\uf0b7 Scrapping old government vehicles, \n\uf0b7 Urban planning reforms and actions, \n\uf0b7 Financing reforms in urban local bodies to make them \ncreditworthy for municipal bonds, \n\uf0b7 Housing for police personnel above or as part of police stations,  \n\uf0b7 Constructing Unity Malls, \n\uf0b7 Children and adolescents\u2019 libraries and digital infrastructure, \nand \n\uf0b7 State share of capital expenditure of central schemes. \nFiscal Deficit of States \n112. States will be allowed a fiscal deficit of 3.5 per cent of GSDP of which \n0.5 per cent will be tied to power sector reforms.  \nRevised Estimates 2022-23 \n113. The Revised Estimate of the total receipts other than borrowings is  \n` 24.3 lakh crore, of which the net tax receipts  \nare ` 20.9 lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure is  \n` 41.9 lakh crore, of which the capital expenditure is about ` 7.3 lakh crore.      \n114. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 6.4 per cent of GDP, \nadhering to the Budget Estimate.        \nBudget Estimates 2023-24 \n115. Coming to 2023-24, the total receipts other than borrowings and the \ntotal expenditure are estimated at ` 27.2 lakh crore and ` 45 lakh crore \nrespectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 23.3 lakh crore.", "29": "26 \n \n \n 116. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 5.9 per cent of GDP. In my \nBudget Speech for 2021-22, I had announced that we plan to continue the \npath of fiscal consolidation, reaching a fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent by \n2025-26 with a fairly steady decline over the period. We have adhered to \nthis path, and I reiterate my intention to bring the fiscal deficit below 4.5 \nper cent of GDP by 2025-26.  \n117.  To finance the fiscal deficit in 2023-24, the net market borrowings \nfrom dated securities are estimated at ` 11.8 lakh crore. The balance \nfinancing is expected to come from small savings and other sources. The \ngross market borrowings are estimated at ` 15.4 lakh crore. \nI will, now, move to Part B.", "30": "27 \n \n \n PART B \nIndirect Taxes \n118. My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic \nmanufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy \nand mobility.  \n119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing \ncompliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce \nthe number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and \nagriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic \ncustom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, \nbicycles, automobiles and naphtha. \n \nGreen Mobility \n120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I \npropose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained \nin it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption \nis being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for \nmanufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. \nElectronics  \n121. As a result of various initiatives of the Government, including the \nPhased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has \nincreased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to \n31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year. To \nfurther deepen domestic value addition in manufacture of mobile phones, I \npropose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain parts and \ninputs like camera lens and continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion \ncells for batteries for another year.  ", "31": "28 \n \n \n 122. Similarly, to promote value addition in manufacture of televisions, I \npropose to reduce the basic customs duty on parts of open cells of TV \npanels to 2.5 per cent.  \nElectrical  \n123. To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing \nof electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen \nchimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on \nheat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per \ncent. \nChemicals and Petrochemicals  \n124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. \n I propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. This will also support the \nEthanol Blending Programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy \ntransition. Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar \nfrom 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals \nindustry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for \nuse in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 \nper cent to 2.5 per cent. \nMarine products \n125. In the last financial year, marine products recorded the highest \nexport growth benefitting farmers in the coastal states of the country. To \nfurther enhance the export competitiveness of marine products, \nparticularly shrimps, duty is being reduced on key inputs for domestic \nmanufacture of shrimp feed. \nLab Grown Diamonds \n126. India is a global leader in cutting and polishing of natural diamonds, \ncontributing about three-fourths of the global turnover by value. With the \ndepletion in deposits of natural diamonds, the industry is moving towards \nLab Grown Diamonds (LGDs) and it holds huge promise. To seize this ", "32": "29 \n \n \n opportunity, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on seeds used in their \nmanufacture.  \n \nPrecious Metals \n127. Customs Duties on dore and bars of gold and platinum were \nincreased earlier this fiscal. I now propose to increase the duties on articles \nmade therefrom to enhance the duty differential. I also propose to increase \nthe import duty on silver dore, bars and articles to align them with that on \ngold and platinum. \nMetals \n128. To facilitate availability of raw materials for the steel sector, \nexemption from Basic Customs Duty on raw materials for manufacture of \nCRGO Steel, ferrous scrap and nickel cathode is being continued. \n129. Similarly, the concessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap is \nalso being continued to ensure the availability of raw materials for \nsecondary copper producers who are mainly in the MSME sector. \nCompounded Rubber \n130. The basic customs duty rate on compounded rubber is being \nincreased from 10 per cent to \u201825 per cent or ` 30/kg whichever is lower\u2019, at \npar with that on natural rubber other than latex, to curb circumvention of \nduty.  \nCigarettes \n131. National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on specified cigarettes \nwas last revised three years ago. This is proposed to be revised upwards by \nabout 16 per cent.", "33": "30 \n \n \n  \nDirect Taxes \n132. I now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to \nmaintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise \nvarious provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the \nentrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. \n133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department \nto improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our \ntax payers\u2019 portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; \nprocessed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period \nreduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  \nand 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend \nto further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form \nfor tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance \nredressal mechanism.  \nMSMEs and Professionals  \n134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy.  Micro enterprises with \nturnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  \n` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide \nenhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers \nwhose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support \nMSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for \nexpenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is \nactually made.  \nCooperation \n135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime \nMinister\u2019s goal of \u201cSahkar se Samriddhi \u201d, and his resolve to \u201cconnect the \nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal\u201d, in addition to the \nmeasures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative \nsector.  ", "34": "31 \n \n \n 136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till \n31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is \npresently available to new manufacturing companies. \n137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives \nto claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to \nassessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them \nwith a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore.  \n138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash \ndeposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies \n(PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks \n(PCARDBs).  \n139. Similarly, a higher limit of ` 3 crore for TDS on cash withdrawal is \nbeing provided to co-operative societies. \nStart-Ups \n140. Entrepreneurship is vital for a country\u2019s economic development. We \nhave taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. \nIndia is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks \nsecond in innovation quality among middle-income countries. I propose to \nextend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from \n31.03.23 to 31.3.24. I further propose to provide the benefit of carry \nforward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years \nof incorporation to ten years. \nAppeals \n141. To reduce the pendency of appeals at Commissioner level, I propose \nto deploy about 100 Joint Commissioners for disposal of small appeals. We \nshall also be more selective in taking up cases for scrutiny of returns already \nreceived this year. \n \n ", "35": "32 \n \n \n Better targeting of tax concessions \n142. For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions, \n I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential \nhouse under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with \nsimilar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance \npolicies with very high value. \nRationalisation \n143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and \nsimplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by \nstatutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of \ncities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an \nactivity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax. Other \nmajor measures in this direction are: \n\uf0b7 Removing the minimum threshold of ` 10,000/- for TDS and \nclarifying taxability relating to online gaming; \n\uf0b7 Not treating conversion of gold into electronic gold receipt and vice \nversa as capital gain;  \n\uf0b7 Reducing the TDS rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent on taxable \nportion of EPF withdrawal in non-PAN cases; and \n\uf0b7 Taxation on income from Market Linked Debentures. \nOthers \n144. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to the following: \n\uf0b7 Extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to IFSC, GIFT \nCity till 31.03.2025; \n\uf0b7 Decriminalisation under section 276A of the Income Tax Act; \n\uf0b7 Allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including \nthat of IDBI Bank; and \n\uf0b7 Providing EEE status to Agniveer Fund. \n ", "36": "33 \n \n \n Personal Income Tax \n145. Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I \nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \npay any tax.  \n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \n` 0-3 lakh Nil \n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \n \n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \n149. My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners \nincluding family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of ", "37": "34 \n \n \n standard deduction to the new tax regime. Each salaried person with an \nincome of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. \n150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \nregime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \nbenefit of the old tax regime. \n153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in \nthe annexure. \n154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore \u2013  \n` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes \u2013 will be \nforgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. \nThus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. \n155.

It is proposed that the for those \nindividuals, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP \nunder the new regime, surcharge would be same except that the \nsurcharge rate of 37 per cent will not apply. Highest surcharge \nshall be 25 per cent for income above  \n` 2 crore. This would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7 \nper cent to about 39 per cent. No change in surcharge is proposed \nfor those who opt to be under the old regime. \nA.8      Encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at \nthe time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an \nemployee of the Central Government or State Government), is \nexempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10AA) of section 10 of the \nIncome-tax Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) to the extent notified.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC WELFARE MEASURES  \nB.1 Promoting  timely payments to Micro and Small Enterprises  \nIn order to promote timely payments to micro and small \nenterprises, it is proposed to include payments made to such \nenterprises within the ambit of section 43B of the Act.

Poor documentation can be attributed to poor \nknowledge, poor attitudes and commitment, and lack of training. \nThis handbook has been developed to provide doctors and medical \nstudents with guidelines on documenting medical records to the required \nlevel of quality, as defined by the Royal College of Physicians (2009) and \nthe World Health Organization (2006). \nOrganised for easy reference, the handbook explains:\n\u2022 what a medical record is and what it is used for\n\u2022 the attributes of a quality medical record\n\u2022 how doctors should complete entries in a medical record\n\u2022 how doctors should correct errors in a medical record.  \nThe handbook is aimed primarily at junior doctors whose first language is \nnot English, especially those in Sri Lanka and the Asia Pacific region.", "6": "3\nDocumenting medical records: A handbook for doctorsImportance of proper documentation of \nMedical Records\nMedical records are important tools for communicating the progress \nof a patient. They also provide valuable information related to disease \nepidemiology, which is crucial for the health system of a country and, \nthereby, the health of a nation.\nA country\u2019s health statistics\nHealth statistics are public goods needed not only by health institutions \nbut by governments, businesses, the media, researchers, civil society, \ndonors and international organisations. All countries need accurate \nand quality health statistics to fully develop socially and economically. \nPolicymakers need accurate and quality health statistics to make the right \nhealth-related decisions. \nThe quality of health statistics depends primarily on the quality of medical \nrecords as documented by doctors. \nThe history and progress of the patient\nA patient\u2019s medical record communicates information about their progress \nto the physicians and other health professionals who are providing care \nto the patient. It is a communication link among the patient\u2019s care-givers. \nFor those health professionals who provide care on subsequent occasions, \nthe medical record provides critical information, such as the history of \nillnesses and the treatment provided. \nLegal documents\nMedical records provide evidence that may assist in protecting the legal \ninterests of the patient, the physician and/or the healthcare institution. ", "7": "4\nPublic health programs and hospital plans \nPublic health professionals use the information in medical records for \nplanning preventive and control programs, evaluating and re-planning \nexisting programs, and developing screening and surveillance programs. \nHealth administrators and hospital managers derive data from medical \nrecords for planning, for allocating resources and for management \npurposes. \nTrends and patterns of diseases\nFor epidemiologists, researchers and healthcare managers who monitor \ntrends and patterns of diseases, information compiled from medical \nrecords is vital. In many countries, medical records are the only source \nof information on the magnitude of disease groups such as NCDs (non-\ncommunicable diseases).\nMorbidity statistics\nMedical records are the main source of morbidity statistics which are \nused in public health planning for NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension \nand cancers. Without accurate records, reducing the burden of NCDs is \nhampered. \nCase studies\nMedical records provide real case studies which can be used for educating \nhealth professionals.", "8": "5\nDocumenting medical records: A handbook for doctorsWhat is a Medical Record?\nA medical record is a compilation of pertinent facts about a patient\u2019s life \nand health history, including past and present illnesses and treatments. It \nis written by the health professionals contributing to the patient\u2019s care.\nWhy do we keep medical records?\nWe keep medical records for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022 for communication purposes while caring for the patient\n\u2022 for continuity of patient care over the course of the patient\u2019s life\n\u2022 for evaluating patient care\n\u2022 for medico-legal purposes\n\u2022 for use as a source of health statistics\n\u2022 for research, education and planning purposes.\nWho is responsible for making \nentries in the medical record?\nA medical record is generated at the point at which a patient gets \nadmitted to a ward in a healthcare institution. Depending on the country \nand the institution, a new medical record may be created each time the \npatient is admitted, or the medical record may move from ward to ward or \ninstitution to institution. \nThe first page of the medical record is called the Admission Form. \nAlthough several people may contribute to it, the admitting doctor of \nthe health institution is the person mainly responsible for documenting \nthe first page. The patient is admitted to the relevant ward with this \npartially completed medical record. Thereafter, the ward doctors (Intern \nMedical Officers, Senior House Officers, Registrars, Senior Registrars \nand Consultants) and nurses attached to this ward are responsible for \ndocumenting pertinent information about the patient until the separation \nof the patient from the ward either by discharge or death.

(1) All activities of government should be pre-\ndetermined and set out in Plans and Pr ogrammes.  The annual estimates of \nexpenditure for a particular financial ye ar are the financial expression of the \nGovernment\u2019s Programmes of activity du ring such year. Plans  and programmes \nare composed of projects. The incorporat ion of Capital Projects in the Annual \nEstimates of Expenditure will be on the basis of the Public Investment \nProgramme where allocations will be indi cated under two categories namely on-\ngoing ( Continuation) and New Projects.   \n \n(2) Project Planning and the Two Staged Approval Procedure \n           (i) For the purpose of planning and approval, projects are classed  into-      \n    \n     (a) Sectoral Plans  \n  Sectoral Plans are multi year ( normally 5 years) programmes of a \nparticular sector. They are prepared by the line Ministries or Departments, \nin consultation with and with the a ssistance of the National Planning \nDepartment and should be included in the Two-Stage Procedure. Such \nPlans  will  normally  form  the  basis for   identification   of   new projects, \n   ( many or which may, in themselves  be quite small) and should therefore \nbe submitted for Preliminary Approv al to the Cabinet of Ministers \nthrough the National Planning Department and the Committee of \nDevelopment Secretaries. \n   \n            (b) Large Projects  \nA large project is one the initial co st of which is not less than Rs. \n10,000,000 and the recurrent annual op eration and maintenance cost \nexceeds Rs, 500,000.  Such projects shou ld pass through the full two stage \nprocedure. However, in the case of large projects which are parts of a \nSectoral Plan or Programme and have received preliminary approval of \nthe Cabinet during the last five years , such projects will be accepted as \nhaving received the preliminary approval. The National Planning \nDepartment and the Central Environm ent Authority should however be \ninformed and comments be obtained before detailed formulation of the \nprojects commences. \n             \n                              \n \n \n ", "12": "   \n7 \n (c)   Small Projects  \nSmall Projects are defined as projects with a capital cost less than \nRs.10,000,000 and a recurrent operation and maintenance cost less than Rs. \n500,000 per annum. It is not permitte d to break down a project into \nseparate components in order to cla ssify it as a small project. Small \nprojects need not pass through both st ages of the two-stage procedure if \nthe project is not part of an approved sectoral Plan or Programme. It must \nbe submitted for preliminary approv al to the Committee of Development \nSecretaries in the usual manner. Once such approval has been granted the \nproject will be included in the Public Investment Programme. \n \n(ii) Project Planning should pass through the following \nstages:- \n             \n(a) Identification \n(b) Preliminary Appraisal \n(c) Preliminary Approval (Approval-in-Principle) \n(d) Preparation \n(e) Full Appraisal \n(f) Final Approval ( Final Round Approval) \n(g) Inclusion in the Public Investment Programme \n(h) Incorporation into the Budget \n(i) Implementation \n(j) Evaluation \n \n(iii) Two Stage Approval Procedure   \nTwo Stage Approval Procedure of Projects consists of \nPreliminary Approval and Final Approval. \n \n(a) The relevant Department or Public Institution shall \nidentify the project and prepare a Pre-Feasibility \nreport with the assistance of the possible Aid Donors \nand submit it to the Sponsoring Ministry. \n \n(b) The Sponsoring Ministry if accepted will submit the \nproject in the Preliminary Approval form to the \nNational Planning Department and the Committee of \nDevelopment Secretaries. \n \n(c) National Planning Department will do a preliminary \nappraisal and report to the Committee of \nDevelopment Secretaries. \n             \n                                                                                                                                           \n \n \n \n \n ", "13": " \n                                                                                                                                              8 \n \n(d) Committee of Development Secretaries, if necessary, in    \nconsultation with the other Mini stries recommends the project to \nthe Cabinet for Preliminary Approval. \n \n(e) When the preliminary Approval is granted by the Cabinet, the pre-\nFeasibility report of the project is passed on to the Sponsoring \nMinistry and if necessary to the External Resources Department. \n \n(f) Then the Sponsoring Ministry  along with Department/Public \nInstitution should do a feasibility study, formulate the project with \nthe assistance of the possible aid donors and in consultation with \nthe Inter-Disciplinary Committee, if any; and submit it to the \nCommittee of Development Secretaries in the Final Approval Form. \n \n(g) National Planning Department will do the final appraisal of the \nproject and report to the Committee of Development Secretaries. \n \n(h) The Committee of Development Secretaries will consider the \nProject Proposal along with the Final Appraisal Report and in \nconsultation with other relevant Ministries and recommend to the \nCabinet who will grant the Final Approval. \n \n (iv)  Planning Unit  \n  A Planning Unit should be  set up in each Ministry.

Programme  project format provides an \noccasion for evaluation of on-g oing programmes and projects, of \nbalancing one project against anothe r and of identifying in precise \nor measurable terms, the benefits  of further investment. It is \npossible that the Secretary/Head of Department would be in a \nposition to meet his needs by revising the priorities amongst \nexisting projects so that if he is  scaling up the activities under one \nproject, he could achieve this with the existing resources and \nallocations by scaling down on other projects of low priority. \n \n(iii)    Any new staff proposals shou ld indicate how the present staff are \ndeployed and what percentage of their time is being spent on the \nvarious activities of the project.

Under Article \n150(1) of the Constitution, it is necess ary that a Warrant, under the hand of the \nMinister in charge of the subject of Financ e, should be issued before any charge is \nmade on the Consolidated Fund.  For the purpose of complying with this \nrequirement, the following warrants are issu ed under the hand of the Minister of \nFinance.  No expenditure should theref ore be incurred before these Warrants are \nissued: \n \n(a) General Warrant - This is a Warrant which gran ts authority for charging \nexpenditure on the Consolidated Fund in respect of Supply Services \nprovided for in Part I of the Annu al Estimates and the Appropriation \nAct, over which the Cabinet does not de sire to retain a special control.  \nThe services for which the General Warrant is issued are prescribed in \na schedule attached thereto.  Normally, the General Warrant will \ncontain authority for expenditure on  all Supply Services provided for \nin the Annual Estimates; but, in  special circumstances, when the \nCabinet wises to withhold expenditur e over certain supply Services, it \nwill direct the Minister of Finance to exclude them from the schedule \nto the General Warrant. \n \n(b) Requisition \u2013 If the authority for the rele ase of money for expenditure \non any of the Supply Services has b een withheld, as explained above, \nand the Cabinet subsequently decided to incur the expenditure, partly \nor wholly, it may direct the Minister  of Finance to issue the necessary \nauthority.  The Minister of Finance will thereupon issue a Warrant on \nForm Treasury 77 granting the nece ssary authority.  This Warrant is \nknown as a \u201cRequisition\u201d. \n \n(c) Special Warrant  -  After a resolution of  Parliament authorizing a \nSupplementary Estimate is passed, the Minister of Finance issues a \nWarrant to release money required fo r expenditure on the services \nprovided for in the Supplementary Estimate.  This Warrant is known \nas a \u201cSpecial Warrant\u201d. \n \n(d) Special Law Warrants \u2013 For the release of moneys in respect of Special \nLaw Services provided for in the A nnual Estimates (but not authorized \nby the Appropriation Act) a separate Warrant, corresponding to the \nGeneral Warrant for Supply Services, is issued by the Minister of \nFinance on Form Treasury 77.  \n ", "55": " \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                         54 \n \n(e) Supplementary Special Law Warrant \u2013  Similarly, if during the course of a \nfinancial year, a release of additional  money is required on a Special \nLaw Services, a Warrant on Form Treasu ry 77 is issued by the Minister \nof Finance.  \n \n(f) Advance Warrant -  The Minister of Finance will also issue a Warrant in \nrespect of Advance Account Activities  provided for in part II of the \nAnnual Estimates.  A schedule is a ttached to this Warrant, specifying \nthe terms and conditions of expenditure, and the prescribed limits.  \n \nIf the prescribed limits of an  Advance Account are increased \nduring the financial year, an orde r in terms of the Appropriation \nAct will be issued by the Minister of Finance. \n \n(2) Contingencies Fund Advance Warrants will be issued by the Minister of \nFinance for the release of funds from the Contingencies Fund. See F.R.78(c) \n \n(3) All the Warrants referred to above are  addressed to the Secretary to the \nTreasury or the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, who will communicate the \nauthorities contained therein to the de partments concerned through the Chief \nAccounting Officers.  Any expenditure not in conformity with the authority \ncontained in the above Warrants will be disallowed by the Secretary to the \nTreasury, and may be surcharged on the officers responsible. \n \n(4)  The authorities conveyed  by thes e Warrants, except the Contingencies  Fund \nAdvance Warrants, lapse at the end of the financial year to which they relate. \n \nF.R.91 Imprest Authority.  The effect of a Warrant is that money can be legally \nwithdrawn from the Consolidated Fund.  The actual amount of money that each \ndepartment would require for its payments  is determined by the Treasury, on \nthe basis of particulars furnished by the department.  A letter is issued by the \nTreasury to each department concerned,  stipulating the total amount of money \nthat will be released by way of impres t, for expenditure by the department \nduring the financial year.  This letter  is  referred to in these Regulations as the \nImprest Authority, and the amount specif ied therein, as the Limit of Imprest. \n \n This Limit should not be exceed ed unless a Supplementary Imprest \nAuthority has been obtained. \n \n \n \n(NO F.R.

Internal Audit.  (1) Object \u2013 (a)For the purpose of  the discharge of their \nduties and responsibilities indicated in F.R.128, Accounting Officers, particularly \nthose of large Departments having sub-o ffices, workshops, stores, etc., and of \ndepartments engaged in development wo rk, should establish Internal Audit \nunits in their departments, the main objects of which are \u2013  \n \n(j) to participate in the system of  internal control of the financial \noperations of the department and carry out a continuous survey and \nan independent appraisal of such operations and the soundness and \nadequacy of the internal checks  adopted in the prevention and \ndetection of errors and frauds; \n \n(ii)  to assist the Accounting Officer and the Progress/Monitoring \nCommittee, in  ascertaining th e progress made on development \nworks, projects and schemes, and in  the fulfillment of the plans and \nprogrammes laid down for or unde rtaken by the department; see \nF.R.4 (5); \n \n     (iii)  to act where appropriate,  as a liaison between those engaged in \nthese tasks and the Head of the De partment and progress/Monitoring \nCommittee. \n \nThe functions of Internal Audit under ( ii) & (iii) above, w ill be purely that \nof a reporting agency. \n \n(b)  In the case of small department s which can effectively be supervised \nand controlled without such assistance , Internal Audit units may not be \nnecessary.  However, if there is an In ternal Audit unit attached to the \nMinistry concerned, the Chief Accounting Officer may extend the scope of \nthe work of such unit to cover the work performed by the smaller \ndepartments of the Ministry. \n \n  (2)Functions and scope of the work of Internal Audit Units.  (a) The \nfunctions of the Internal Audit in re lation to financial operations of a \ndepartment comprise the following:- \n \ni. Ascertaining whether the system of internal check and \ncontrol obtaining in the depart ment for the prevention of \nerrors and frauds is effective in  design as well as in actual \noperation \n \nii. Ascertaining the reliability of the accounting and other \nrecords and seeking that the accounting methods \nemployed provide the information necessary for the \npreparation of correct financial statement. \n \n ", "82": "   \n                                                                                                                                         83 \n \n \niii.

Ascertaining whether the Establishments Code, Financial \nRegulations of Government and other supplementary \ninstructions issued from time to time by the Ministry in \ncharge of the subject of Public  Administration and  by the \nTreasury are being followed. \n \nvi. Ascertaining the effectivene ss of the system of internal \ncontrol adopted in preventing, as well as detecting waste, \nidle capacity and extravagance. \n \nvii. Examining the accounting procedure of the department \nand its operations which have any financial implications, \nand verifying the safety, econ omical and proper use of \nproperty and assets of the department. \n \nviii. Carrying out special investigations when necessary. \n \n(b) The functions of the Internal Audit in assisting the Accounting \nOfficer and the Progress/Monitori ng Committee in ascertaining \nprogress of works, schemes and projects, comprise the following: \n \n(i) Inspecting and reporting on the operational functions of the \ndepartment, from a managerial, as opposed to a technical or \naccounting point of view. \n \n(ii) Appraisal of the progress of works, schemes and projects ad \nthe extent \n to which programmes and schedules are on target. \n \n(iii) On \u2013  the  - spot investigation into problem areas which delay  \n execution. \n \n(iv) Appraisal and review of the controls adopted in the \nsupervision of such operations. \n \n F.R.134, (1) Independence of Internal Audit.  The Internal Audit unit \nshould be independent of the control of  those who are responsible for or are \nactually carrying out the financial and a ccounting operation of the department, \nas well as those engaged in the execution of schemes and projects or performance \nof works and services rendered by the department. \n ", "83": " \n \n                                                                                                                                84 \n \n             It is essential that, in relation to financial and accounting matters, the \nInternal Audit report direct to the  Head of Department. \n \n (2)Internal Audit Programme relating to financial matters. \u2013  Internal \nAudit programmes for the survey of the financial aspects of the work of a \ndepartment should be carefully prepare d, in order to enable a systematic, \nadequate and efficient check on such work. It is desirable to consult the Auditor- \nGeneral in preparing this programme. \n \n (3)Internal Audit Reports. \u2013  Copies of  Internal Audit reports pertaining to \nthe financial operations of a department , should be furnished to the Auditor \u2013\nGeneral. \n \n F.R.135. Delegation of Functions for Financial Control . (1) An accounting \nOfficer may delegate his functions either generally or with regard to individual \ntransaction; but he must do so in a reason able way.  In particular he must satisfy \nhimself in regard to the co mpetence of those to whom authority is delegated, and \nin regard to the adequacy of internal ch ecks in the system of delegation.  The \nAccounting Officer will be responsible for his scheme of delegation and for \nsupervising the system of financial cont rol generally.  His scheme of delegation \nwill naturally be determined by the or ganization of the department, except \nwhere geographical and technical factors necessitate special arrangements.  \nWhenever possible the duties should be so divided that each transaction passes \nthrough two or three different officers. \n \n(2)  An officer to whom functions have been delegated will have full discretion to  \nperform the duties delegated to him and w ill be held accountable for his acts.  It \nwill also be his duty to keep the A ccounting Officer acquainted of any \ntransactions, which involve novel principl e, or are of sufficient importance, to \nmerit the Accounting Officer\u2019s personal a ttention.  On the other hand, and act of \ndelegation will not relieve an Accounting O fficer of his ultimate responsibility.  If \nan officer exceeds or misuses his delega ted powers, or fails to carry out his \nduties, he will be accountable for such acts and defaults.  In such a case, \nhowever, the Accounting Officer will no t be held responsible, unless the \nexcesses, misuses or defaults are attributable to causes within his control. \n \n \n(3)  In turn, an officer holding a delega tion can entrust to his subordinates the \nroutine or minor tasks connected with an d within the limits of his delegation.  \nThis does not, however, absolve hi m of his own responsibility to his \nAccounting Officer. \n \n(4)  Whenever the Accounting Officer intends to delegate one or more of \nhis functions, he should prepare a Schedule  specifying each officer, by name or \noffice, and the functions delegated to him.   In the case of delegation for the \ncontrol of expenditure, the Accounting Officer may  \n ", "84": "   \n85 \n \nLink particular functions with  specific allo cations.  At the same time any limitations \nimposed on the character or amount  of individual transactions should be specified.   \nArrangements to cover  absence from duty must also be shown on the Schedule, which \nshould be revised periodically  and calculated  in the department generally.  Copies of  \ndelegations relating to expenditure should  be supplied, in particular, to each \nAuthorizing, Approving, Certifying and Paying  officer; and copies of delegations in \nrespect of the receipt of money, to each A ssessing, Collecting and Accepting Officer.  A \ncopy should also be sent to the Auditor-Gen eral.  If necessary the advice of the Chief \nAccounting Officer or of the  Treasury (Dep artment  of Public Finance)  may be sought \nconcerning the  Schedule.   \n \n It is important that  the  scope of de legation should be set down in writing \nso that there may be no doubt  in the  future about the nature of the \nresponsibilities of the officers to whom  authority has been delegated.  Such \ndelegations should be periodically revi ewed   and any revisions brought to the \nnotice of officers concerned.  \n \n(5) The following stages or functions may be distinguished :- \n \n(a) Expenditure : \n(i) Authorization. \n(ii) Approval. \n(iii) Certification. \n(iv) Payment. \n \n(b) Income  : \n(i) Assessment. \n(ii) Collection. \n(iii) Acceptance. \n \nIn  particular circumstances, a dele gation  of authority granted to \nan individual officer by an A ccounting Officer  may  involve \nmore than one of the above stages or functions.  \n \nF.R. 136.   Authorization. An officer, who is empowered to \ncommission supplies, works or serv ices, is referred to in these \nRegulations as Authorizing Officer.  The decision  to make such \nan authorizations is in his discr etion  and he must accept full \nresponsibility with regard to it.  Any officer empowered to \ncommission supplies, works or servic es will do so in  writing and \nwill be responsible to the Accounting Officer in the following \nrespects :-  \n \n(1) that the work, supply or serv ice is covered by appropriate  \nauthority, and falls within the  scope of the vote  or other \nauthorized financial provision and/or  is properly chargeable  to the \naccounts involved; \n \n ", "85": " \n \n86 \n \n(2) that he exercises due judgemen t; that he does not exceed the \nspecified  limits of his  authority; and that every step in the \nprocedure set down  in the Financ ial Regulations has been duly   \ntaken (e.g. decisions of tender boards); \n \n(3) that the commitments which are expected  to mature for payment \nin a particular financial year  do not exceed the funds available in \nhis respective allocations; \n \n(4) that the sums due on commitments as they arise against each of his  \nallocations (or his allocations to other departments) and the \namounts recorded are subjected to continuous  review in the  light \nof further information  that becomes available as work progresses; \n \n(5) that the information mentioned in (4) above is passed periodically  \nto the Certifying Officer; \n \n(6) that his records are compared an d reconciled at least once a month \nwith those of the Certifying  O fficer so that he may know the \nprecise  amount available for further commitments; \n \n(7) that in any case involving reason able doubt as to the availability of \nfunds, or as to the  economy or fi nancial propriety of transactions \ngenerally, he seeks the advice of  the Accountant or Officer in \ncharge of accounting operations. \n \nNote 1  -  An officer empowered  to au thorize  services must  first \nensure that the necessary  prelimin aries \u2013  such as the approval of  \nAnnual Estimates,  works estimates, etc.  have been carried out.  \nNevertheless, these prior decisions, at whatever level, do not \nproduce firm  commitments.    The final authorization  must \ninvolve a free judgement by the Au thorizing Officer personally.  \nWhere a proposed transaction is  subject to  Tender Board \nprocedure, the Authorizing Officer will vouch for the necessity  \nfor the expenditure, but the Bo ard will take responsibility for \ndeciding the basis of purchase, etc. \n \nNote 2.  \u2013 Also see F.R. 201 (1) \n \nF.R. 137.  Approval.  An officer who is empowered to approve \nservices, works or supplies on completion and to admit claims is \nreferred to in these Regulations as Approving Officer.  He will be \nresponsible to the Accounting Officer for verifying : \n(1) that the work, service or supply arises out of an \nauthorization by  the appr opriate Authorizing Officer \nand/or out of an  Agreement; \n \n \n ", "86": "   \n87 \n(2) That the work or servic e has been performed or the supply rendered in terms \nof such authorization and/or a releva nt Agreement  and any authorized  \nvariations therefrom in any respect, espe cially with regard to compliance with \nterms relating  to qualify of materials us ed,   the quantities and the period or \nperiods of time within which portions of the contract have to be completed ; \n \n (3)   that the rates and the  total sums approved for payment are in accordance \nwith authorized  scales or in terms of the  Agreement or any authorized variations and \nwhere there is no authorized or standard rate s or Agreement, that the rates are fair and \nreasonable ; \n  \n(4)  that in a contract of employme nt the appropriate conditions, rules \nand regulations have been complied with ; \n \n (5)   that in the case of supplies, they have been examined and correctly \ntaken on charge or otherwise accounted for in terms of the Regulations or \ninstructions of Government ; \n \n (6)   that in the case of bills fo r  payment of electricity, gas, water, \ntelephone  and other similar  services  supplied, they are checked with Registers \nkept to show the monthly meter  readings  and other relevant particulars.  If the \namounts billed in a particular month devi ate widely  from the average normal \nmonthly consumption pattern,  such cases should be investigated and remedial \naction, where necessary, taken. \n \n Note.- See also Financial Regulation 201 (2). \n \n F.R. 138.  Certification of Vouchers.  An officer who is empowered to \ncertify vouchers is referred to in these Regulations as Certifying Officer.  He is \nresponsible to the Accounting Officer to see :- \n \n (1) that the amount payable on each vo ucher is a correct charge on the Head,  \nProgramme, Project, Object Class, etc., or the relevant Account, and is covered by a \nWarrant  signed by the Minister of Finance, or is covered by other appropriate authority \n; \n \n (2)   that the payment will not cause an excess on the amount provided for the \ncurrent financial year and that it has been po sted in the Appropriation (Votes) Ledger or \nother appropriate Ledger, under the relevant  Head, Programme, Project, Object Class, \netc., or the relevant Account ;  \n \n (3)   that the payees shown on the face of the voucher are the persons entitled to \npayment and that the amount provided  for  payment to each of them is correct ; \n \n (4)  that he attests on the face of the voucher that he has satisfied  himself either \nfrom personal knowledge or from certificat es,  statements or orders of officers  \nempowered to give them, that the provisions of F.RR 136 and 137 have been complied \nwith ; \n \n \n ", "87": " \n88 \n \n (5) that an indication of the fact that he has certified a voucher for the payment \ninvolved, is made on the records, files or ot her relevant documents, in order to prevent \nanother voucher for the same paymen t being certified subsequently ; \n \n (6)  that the certificates, etc., referred to  in (4) above, are attached to the  \nvoucher or that the latter bears a note q uoting reference to the  files in which they \nappear; \n \n (7)  that all relevant deductions and th ose notified  to him or authorized or \nrequired to be recovered have been made, particularly in respect of repayment of \nadvances, contributions, su rcharges, penalties, forfeitures  or other liabilities ; \n \n(8) that the voucher is accurate  and complete in every detail; \n \n (9)   that he ex ercises judgement, discretion and initiative in the light of the \ngeneral conditions prevailing in the  departme nt in which he serves.  For example, each \nAuthorizing Officer is  responsible for  keeping within his own Allocation, but if the \nCertifying Officer sees that there is a d anger of commitments exceeding an Allocation, \nhe should draw the Authorizing Officer\u2019s a ttention to the matter.  Moreover, there may \nbe occasions when a Certifying Officer has  serious doubts about accepting vouchers \nwhich appear correct in every formal respec t.  Again, general standards of financial \nmanagement, or particular transactions, may have disq uieting features even before the \nstage of voucher preparation is reached.  In any such case the Certifying Officer \nconcerned  has the right and the duty to repres ent the matter to his superior officer,  and \nif necessary, to the Accounting Officer pers onally with a request for specific written \ndirections. \n \n Note 1. -  In the case of payments from Depo sits,  there will be  two Certifying \nOfficers whose responsibilities are indicated in F.R. 206. \n \n Note 2. -  Also see F.R. 201 (3) \n \n F.R. 139. Payment of Vouchers.  An  Officer who is empowered to make \npayments on certified vouchers is referred to in these Regulations as Paying Officer.  He \nwill be responsible to the Accounting Officer to see :- \n \n (1)   that every voucher accepted for payment has been certified by an officer \nwho has the authority to do so;  \n \n (2) that the voucher shows no evidence of  having been   tampered with since it \nleft the Certifying Officer\u2019s hands ; \n \n (3) that any facts within his special knowledge  are duly taken into account \nbefore payment is made ; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "88": "   \n89 \n \n(4) that a proper receipt is obtained for every  payment made; \n \n(5) that the identity of the payee is established ; \n \n (6) that in the case of a payment by cheq ue, money order, etc., the name and \nother particulars appearing on the cheq ue or on the money order application, agree with \nthose shown on the face of the voucher ; \n \n (7) that the net amount shown on the  face of the  voucher is duly paid, and the \nfact of payment noted on the voucher by me ans of a \u201cPAID\u201d stamp, and initialed ;  \n \n (8) that every payment is promptly noted in the prescribed records and duly \nbrought to account ; \n \n (9) that where cash is entrusted to hi s care, he takes due precautions against \ntheft or loss; and that the balance in hand ag rees with the balance appearing in the cash \nbook at the close of each day\u2019s  business ; \n \n(10) that, in the case of cheque payments,  \n \n(i) the Bank balance is adequate to meet all payments; \n(ii) the  number of the cheque is noted on the voucher; \n(iii) the balance is reconciled periodically with the  bank statement. \n \n F.R. 140. Passing of Vouchers for Payment. In cases where the officer \nempowered to pass certified vouchers for payment is different from the officer \nempowered to make  payments, the former w ill take responsibility  in terms of F.R. 139 \n(1), (2) and (3); and the latter in respect of F.R. 139, (4) to (10)inclusive.  The latter will \nfurther see :- \n \n(a) that every voucher has been passed for payment by the officer empowered \nto do so; \n \n(b) that the voucher shows no evidence of having been tampered with since it \nleft that officer\u2019s hands; \n \n(c) that any facts within his special knowledge are duly taken into account \nbefore payment is made. \n \n F.R. 141. Bank Accounts.   (1) Where several Paying Officers operate on the same \nbank account, and it is inconvenient  for them to share a common record of cheq ues  \ndrawn, each should be made responsible for a fixed sum. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "89": " \n90 \n \n (2) Where payment is made by cheque , the cheq ue must be signed by two \nofficers who have been duly authorized by the Treasury  on the application of the \nAccounting Officer \u2013  see F.R 381.  The first signat ory shall   sign on the  left of the space \nor on the first line provided for signing the ch eque.  He shall be deemed to be the Paying \nOfficer.  The second signatory shall sign either below or to the right of the first signatory.  \nThe counterfoils shall be init ialed in the same way.  The principal responsibility for the \naccuracy of the cheque  shall be that of the Paying Officer. \n \n \n (3)   The second signatory to a cheq ue  shall be an officer who has no \nresponsibilities under F.R. 139 or F.R. 140, and will be responsible to the Accounting \nOfficer to see :- \n \n(a) that the first signatory has th e authority to sign the cheque; \n \n(b) that the cheque shows no eviden ce of having been tampered with \nsince  it left  the first signatory\u2019s hands; \n \n(c) that the name, amount and other particulars appearing on the \ncheque agree with those shown on the voucher; \n \n(d) that the voucher has been certified by an officer authorised to do \nso; \n \n(e) that the first signatory has complied with F.R. 139(7) above; \n \n(f) that he initials a suitable endo rsement on the voucher to indicate \nthat payment has been made.  \n \n \n F.R. 142 (1) Assessment.  Assessment is the process  whereby sums of money \ndue to Government and the persons from wh om they are recoverable are ascertained \nand determined.  It also covers the process of  fixing a levy or a charge for a supply or \nservice rendered by the Government.  The fu nction of ascertaining or determining the \namount due to Government, and from whom, may have been assigned to an officer by \nStatute; but, subject to the  provisions of su ch Statute, and officer charged with this task \nshould accept full responsibilit y with regard to the correctness of the amount involved; \nand, where he is authorized to use his discre tion, he should do so without prejudicing \nthe legitimate  interests of Governme nt, or causing wrongful loss to it. \n \n (2)  Collection.      This is the process of recovering for Government the amount \ndue to it, and  does not cease until such am ount has been received and realized. Where \nservices are rendered, or supply, permit, auth ority, etc., is issued, on the payment of a \nfee or charge,  the function of Collection includes the responsibility to see that no such \nservice is rendered, nor supply, permit, etc., issued, until the required fee or charge is \nreceived and realized. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "90": "   \n91 \n \n Though  the act  of  receiving  money is  not a necessary part of the  function of \nCollection , a Collecting Officer may sometimes be required to receive money.   \nWhere a Collecting Officer receives money directly he will issue a receipt to the payer \nand remit the amount, as required in F.R. 177,  to an Accepting Officer, to be brought to \naccount correctly.   \n \n In most  \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019  Class Departments, Collecting Officers do receive money \ndirectly which they should remit to an Acce pting Officer.  \u2018A\u2019 Class Departments  and \nKachcheries  are in themselves  Accepting O fficers and their dues are usually received \ndirectly by the Accepting Officers themselv es, at the instances of Collecting Officers. \n \n (3)  Control Accounts for Collection.  In the case of regular or  recurrent \ncollections (See F.R. 175), a Collecting Office r should maintain a memorandum control  \n(or Total ) Account which will unable him read ily  to ascertain the total amount due to \nbe collected, the total collections to date  the balance unsettled and/or  the total amount \nof arrears. He should so organize the main tenance officer records that the Control  (or \nTotal) Account, and the individual accounts are simultaneously maintained up to  date, \nand are reconciled regularly. \n \n (4)  Acceptance.

Such collections, being sporadic by \nnature, cannot be computed in advance. \n \n (b) The other type consists of regular taxe s, licences, fees, etc. In such cases, the \ndepartment is aware  of what has to be collected and the date on which \npayments is due.  The Collecting Office r should, in such cases, keep records \nof the amount due from each person, and  ensure that it is duly collected. \n \n When payment is permitted in instal ments, further records of the amount \ndue on each instalment, and the date it falls due, are necessary to see that the \ninstalments are regularly paid  and are  not falling into arrears.  The \nCollecting Officer should ensure that appropriate entries are made in the \nrecords whenever a payment is received.  \n \n \n When collections have to be made from a  large number of persons, the  \nmaintenance  of individual records alone will not  readily show the overall position of \nthe progress of collection.  The Collecting Offi cers should therefore keep supplementary  \nrecords in the form of up-to-date Cont rol Accounts, the nature of which will be \ndetermined by the type of organization whic h obtains in the department.

(1) Payments to private parties \u2013  If a \u2018C\u2019 Class Department in \none station has to make a payment to a person residing in or near another \nstation,the department may issue a vouche r for payment at the Kachcheri nearest \nto the payee's station and send it to th e payee for presentation.  The department \nshould, at the same time, advice the Ka chcheri on Form General 195 of the issue \nof the voucher.  Payment should not be made by the Paying Officer until he has  \nchecked the voucher with the advice and sa tisfied himself as to the identity of the \npayee.  As soon as payment is made, or at the end of 30 days from the date of the \nadvice, whichever is earlier, the Paying Office should return the advice to the \nissuing department, with the date of pa yment inserted therein, if the voucher \nhas been paid.  The issuing department should see that the advice is duly \nreturned by the Paying Office and that th e date of the payment is recorded in its \nbooks.

If, however, the latter depatement is itself a \u2018C\u2019 Class \nDepartment, the procedure indicated in  (1) above can be followed only if \nthe amount payable is within the limit prescribed in F.R.255 (3)(b).

If, on the other hand, paymen t on one voucher, out of a number of \nvouchers received together from th e bank, has to be delayed for any \nreason, the fact should be notified to  the bank when payment on the other \nvouchers is made. \n \n(4) If the voucher has not been ce rtified when received from the \nbank, and the Certifying Officer is hi mself attached to the Office of \nPayment, the voucher should be referred to the Certifying Officer for \ncertification and any other action nece ssary before payment is made.

The Paying \nOfficer should therefore, satisfy himself wi th regard to the identity of the payee if \nhe calls for payment.  The payee should be required to produce his/her National \nIdentity Card.  The number of the National  Identity Card should be recorded on \nthe payment voucher.  In case of doubt, th e payee should be id entified by one or \nmore responsible persons, acceptable to  the Paying Officer, and such person \nshould sign as witnesses to his/her iden tity and signature.  Where the payee is \nunable to write, his/her mark or thumb impression should be obtained in the \npresence of the witnesses who will cert ify on the voucher, that payment was \nmade to the correct person, and that the mark or thumb impression is bona fide. \n \n(2) Payments to legal representati ves \u2013  When payment is made to \nlegal \nrepresentatives, the authority under whic h the payment is made, e.g. Powers of \nAttorney, Letters of Administration, should  be registered in the department, the \nTreasury (Department of State Accounts ) and Audit Office. Reference to such \nauthority should be quoted on the vouc hers, except where the law permits of a \ndeclaration being substituted for Letters of  Administration in cases of succession \nto small Estates.  The legal representative should be required to produce his/her \nNational Identity Card, and the number thereof should be recorded on the \npayment voucher. \n \n            (3) Under this Regulation, officers are liable to be called upon to make \ngood any loss to Government arising out of fraud, neglect, irregular payment, \npayment to incorrect party, or for di sregarding any special rules which are \napplicable. \n \n  \n \n ", "137": " \n141 \n            F.R.261.(1) Vouchers to be numbered.

The entries in the \nCash Book should be consecutively numb ered and these numbers affixed to the \ncorresponding vouchers. \n \n (2) Number of the cheque to be quoted on vouchers.  Where payment is \nmade by cheque, the number of the cheque  should be quoted on the voucher and \nagainst the appropriate entry in the Cash Book. \n \n(3)Adequacy of Funds for Payments.   The Cash Book should be totalled \nand the balance ascertained daily.  No pa yment should be recorded in the Cash \nBook, or a cheque drawn out for payment, unless there is sufficient money \navailable.  Action should be taken to en sure that sufficient money is available to \nmeet the current as well as the impend ing payments, without interruption, by \nmaking an appropriate application to th e relevant authority well in time for \nnecessary funds. \n \n(4) Periodical reconciliation with ledgers, registers, etc. Arrangements \nshould be made to reconcile periodically the payment side of the Cash Book with \nthe payment entries in the other books of account. \n \nF.R. 262. (1) Date of payment recorded in Cash Book.  All payments must \nbe brought to account under the date on  which payment is ma de.

All  vouchers paid and their supporting documents \nshould be stamped with the \u201cPAID\u201d stamp which should bear the date of \npayment as recorded in the Ca sh Book.  Unless this is done in every case, there is \ndanger of vouchers being presented for payment a second time. \n \n(3) Initialling of Paid Vouchers.  Immediately after payment (in the case \nof a payment by cheque, at time of signin g it), the Paying Officer should sign or \ninitial the paid voucher or vouchers in volved and the supporting  documents, \npreferably on the \u2018Paid\u2019 stamp, or in  a particular position specified on the \ndocument. \n   \nF.R.263.(1) Forms of payment.

But th e amount of Imprest money which an \u2018A\u2019 \nClass Department may hold at any one ti me, is not predetermined, although the \nTreasury has the right to prescribe a maximum. \n \n         (3) Treasury\u2019s right of withdrawal \u2013 The Treasury has also the right to \nrecall, at any time, any sum of money from any Imprest granted. \n \n          F.R.367. Fixing of the Limits of Imprests. (a) The Treasury obtains, before \nthe beginning of each financial year, an es timate of the money required by each \ndepartment and officer, to whom an Imprest is to be issued during such financial \nyear.  This estimate, modified where nece ssary, will be the Limit of Imprest of \nthe department/officer concerned. \n \n          (b) Direct receipts of \u2018A\u2019 Class Departments are treated as forming part of  \ntheir Imprests, and are therefore taken into  account in ascertaining the Limits.  \nThus the Limit of Imprest indicated in the Imprest Authority shows the \naggregate amount of - \n \n(i) money that a department or officer receives from the \nDeputy Secretary to the Treasury; and \n(ii) in the case of an \u2018A\u2019 Cl ass Department, the money it \nreceives directly, less any sums remitted from time to \ntime to the Treasury on account of collections in \nexcess of current requirements  \u2013 see also F.R.182(2).  If \nthe direct receipts of the department are less than the \nmoney required, for its current requirements, the \nLimit of the Imprest will be  the total of its direct \nreceipts plus the monies received from the Treasury. \n \n(c) When the Imprest Authority is issued, the Limit of Imprest \nshould be noted and action taken to en sure that it is not exceeded, unless  \na Supplementary Imprest Authority is obtained. \n \n ", "166": "   \n      172 \n  \n           F.R.368.Supplementary Imprest Authority. If, during the course of the \nfinancial year, it is anticipated that the \u2018Limit\u2019 prescribed in the Imprest \nAuthority will be exceeded, action should be taken to obtain an increase of the \n\u2018Limit\u2019 by an application made to the Tr easury (Department of State Accounts), \nthrough the Chief Accounting Officer conc erned, explaining the reasons for the \nincrease.  The Treasury will then issu e a Supplementary Imprest Authority and \nintimate the increased \u2018Limit\u2019 to the dep artment or officer concerned.  The new \n\u2018Limit\u2019 should be noted and action taken to ensure that it is not exceeded. \n \n           F.R.369. Classification of Departme nts for purposes of Imprests.  For the \npurpose of granting Imprests, departments are divided into three groups \u2013  \n \n(a) \u2018A\u2019 Class Departments \u2013  These de partments are continuously kept \nin funds by the Treasury.  Applicat ions for funds are made by these \ndepartments as and when necessary , without submitting Certified \nSchedules of Payments already ma de.  The amount applied for and \ngranted varies according to current  requirements, and is paid into \nthe department\u2019s bank account.  These departments are permitted \nto utilize their direct receipts also as  part of their Imprest.  Officers \nof the Audit Department will gene rally be attached to \u2018A\u2019 Class \nDepartments for the purpose of a continuous audit of their account; \n \n(b) \u2018B\u2019Class Departments \u2013  A fixed sum of money is initially paid into \nthe bank account of each department of this Class, for meeting its    \npayments therefrom.  Once every month, or more frequently, if \nnecessary, a Certified Schedule of Vo uchers is sent to the Treasury \n(Department of State Accounts) along with the following \ndocuments-  \n(i) Application for renewal of credit on Form \nGeneral 103;  \n(ii) Certified Summary of Debits;  \n(iii) Bank Balance Certificate;  \n(iv) A Bank Reconciliation Statement showing the list \nof uncashed cheques ;  \n(v) Certificate to the effe ct that the vouchers in \nsupport of payments have been sent direct to the \nAuditor-General;  \n(vi) A statement showing the position of the Limits of \nthe Imprest Account at the date of application.  \n \nThe Treasury will replenish the ba nk account of the department \nwith an amount equivalent to the total of the Schedule submitted.  \nThis is known as the Renewal of  Imprests.  The relevant paid \nvouchers should be forwarded by the department, direct to the   \nAuditor-General, together with a ce rtified copy of the Schedule of \nVouchers.  \u2018B\u2019 Class Departments are  not permitted to credit their \nbank accounts with direct collections.   \n \n ", "167": " \n \n                                                                                                                 173  \n(c) \u2018C\u2019 Class Departments - \n \n(i) Payments over Rs.100 : \u2018C\u2019 Class Departments make \ntheir payments of over Rs.100 through a Kachcheri or the \nTreasury.  For this purpose ea ch \u2018C\u2019 Class Department is \nassigned to one of the Kachcher ies or to the Treasury \u2013  see \nF.R.255 (3).  Vouchers certified by these departments are \npresented for payment at the us ual Office of Payment, where \nthey will be brought to accoun t.  The collections of these \ndepartments are paid into the Kachcheri or the Treasury, as \nin the case of \u2018B\u2019 Class Departments; \n \n(ii) Petty Cash Payments : \u2018C\u2019 Class Departments will \nmake their payments up to  Rs.100 from the Petty Cash \nImprests issued to them by the Treasury.  Renewal of Petty \nCash Imprests should be obtain ed from the usual office of \nPayment once every month or more frequently, if necessary, \nforwarding on each occasion a Certified Schedule of \nVouchers along with \u2013  \n \n1.

(1) Subjects to the provisions below, an \nAccounting Officer may issue a part of his own Imprest to any of his \nsubordinates.  Such re-issue is referred to in these Regulations as a Sub-Imprest.  \nHowever no part of an Imprest granted by  the Treasury to an officer, other than \nan Accounting Officer, should be re-i ssued to another, without the express \nauthority of the Treasury (Department of State Accounts). \n \n (2) A Sub-Imprest may be granted by an Accounting Officer  \n \n(a) for defraying petty expenses \u2013  in which case it is usually \nreferred to as a Petty Cash Sub-Imprest.  This should not \nnormally exceed Rs.100; however, a Chief Accounting Officer, \nmay at his discretion, authorize a Petty Cash Sub-Imprest up to \na maximum of Rs.5,000 to any offi cer working under the direct \nsupervision of a Staff Officer.  Where a larger Petty Cash Sub-\nImprest is considered necessary, the authority of the Treasury \n(Department of State Accounts) should be obtained. \n \n                                                                                                           \n ", "168": "   \n 174 \n \n(b) as an \u201cad hoc\u201d Sub-Imprest \u2013 not to exceed Rs.20,000 in     \neach case ; \n \n(c)   as a continuous Sub-Imprest to a Sub-Officer for meeting all \nits payments. \n \nThe grant of Sub-Imprests under (b) and (c) above, should be \nlimited to Staff Officers.

(1) Authority and Scope .   Advance Accounts are authorized by \nthe Appropriation Act and provided for under Part II of the Annual Estimate \n(see F.R.17).  Their financial operations  are subject to the provisions of \nAppropriation Act. \n \n (2) Receipts and Payments of Advance Accounts.-  Within the \nprescribed Limits. (see F.R. 17 (2) ), both  receipts and payments of each activity \nconducted on an Advance Account are accounted for under the appropriate \nAdvance Account.  This expedient brings the financial transactions of the activity \ninto a single account, as far as the Treasury is concerned.   \n \n (3) Advance Warrants.-  No debit should be raised to an Advance \nAccount, provided for in the Annual Es timates, unless an Advance Warrant,  or \nSpecial Advance Warrant containing provision for the activity, has been issued \nby the  Minister of Finance (see  F.R.90). \n  \n (4) All Capital Expenditure for the Activity  should be  met from \nspecific Monetary Provision in the Estimates and should not therefore be debited to the \nAdvance Accounts Replacement of capital asse ts should be dealt with as indicated in \nF.R. 509.   \n \n (5) Rendering of Accounts.-  In th e Treasury books the transactions of \nan  Advance Account Activity are recorded  by way of debits and credits to the \nrelevant Advance Account.  For this reas on, when the transact ions of an Advance \nAccount  Activity are brought to account by departments for incorporation in the \nTreasury books, they should be shown as  debits and/or credits to that Advance \nAccount. \n          F.R. 501.  Types of Advance Account Activities .  The type of activity, \nconducted under each main category of Advance Accounts (see F.R.17), is \nindicated below:- \n(a) Stores Advance Accounts.-  These are in the nature of suspense accounts.  \nThe cost of Stores required by a department, including incidental \nexpenses, such as the cost of transpor t and handling, is first met from the \nrelevant stores Advance Account.  When   issues are made to departments, \nor sections of departments, the full value is recovered from appropriate \nprovision in the Estimates (or from th e activity to which the stores have \nbeen supplied) and credited to th e Stores Advance Account Normally, \nStores Advance Account  are not expected  to result in losses, nor are they \nworked on a profit.  Abnormal losses,  such as marine losses, and loss by \nfire, are recovered from specific financial provision made under the \nrelevant object Class of the relevant He ad of Expenditure in  Part  1 of the \nEstimates. \n \n ", "217": " \n                                                                                                                                         224 \n \n(b) Trading and Manufacturing Adva nce Accounts.-  These are made \nuse of for the purpose of carring  on certain activities  on a \ncommercial basis.  The recurrent  expenses of the activity are \ncharged to the Advance Account.  The proceeds, by way of sale or \notherwise of the products of the activity, are credited to the \nAdvance Account. \n \n( c) Special Advance Accounts.-  These accounts are used to pay \nrecoverable advances for specif ic purposes, other than those \nreferred to in (a) and (b) above.  They are a convenient way of \naccounting for loans to Governme nt Officers or members of the \npublic, part payments of clai ms, and payment on behalf of \ninstitutions and other  Governme nts.  These accounts are not \nexpected to result in losses.  Full recovery should be made in terms \nof the conditions authorising the original payment. \n  \n F.R. 502.  Books, Records,  etc, for Control.   (1)BOOKS AND RECORDS.  \nIn respect of each Advance Account Acti vity, Accounting Officers should see \nthat- \n  \n(a) adequate records are maintained  to ensure that there are no \nexcesses in respect of the Maximum of limits of expenditure, \nmaximum limits of the debit balance, maximum limits of liabilities \nand no shortfall on the minimum limits of receipts prescribed  by \nParliament without proper authority \u2013  F.R. 503 : \n \n(c) adequate steps are taken to ensure that- \n \n(i) amounts due are promptly collected; \n(ii) satisfactory progress is made in the working of the activity; \n(iii) proper books of account are maintained to record all \ntransactions relating to the commercial aspect of the activity. \n \nThe Treasury (Department of Public  Enterprises) may, in certain \ncases, prescribe the minimum requir ements in this connection; but, \nas proper records have to  be main tained to suit the requirements of \neach individual activity, Accounting  Officers should act with care, \nand obtain the assistance of th e Chief Accounting Officers, the \nAuditor General and the Treasu ry (Department of Public \nEnterprises) in difficult circumstances. \n \n \n  \n \n \n ", "218": "   \n                                                                                                                                          225 \n       Note.-  Where no specific form is prescribed for the control of Limits, Form \nGeneral 138A (Appropriation (Vote) Account) may be utilized with \nsuitable modifications.  The Maxi mum Limit of Expenditure during \nthe financial year, the minimum Limit of Receipts to be credited to \nthe Account during the financial year and the Maximum Limit of the \nDebit Balance should be carefully  noted.  The Maximum Limit of \nLiabilities, if any, should be noted on the left hand side of the form. \n \n The debit balance brought forward from  the last financial year should also \nbe noted, as this is taken into accoun t in ascertaining the Maximum Limit of \nDebit Balance. \n \n Both debits and credits to the Adva nce Account will be recorded as they \noccur.  It should be noted that cred its, although taken into account in \nascertaining the Maximum Limit of Receip ts and the Maximum  Limit of Debit  \nBalance should not be taken into account  in ascertaining the Maximum Limit of \nExpenditure of the financial year. \n \n (2) Fixed Assets Register.-  A Fixe d Assets Register should also be \nmaintained in respect of each Advance Account Activity.  In it  should be \nrecorded full particulars relating to each fixed asset, such as its cost, description, \ndate of acquisition (or completion), annual rate of depreciation, location, etc. \n \n Detailed instructions regarding Accoun ting for Fixed Assets are given in \nAppendix  11. \n \n F.R. 503. Excesses/Shortfalls of Limits prescribed for Advance Accounts .  \n(1)  Ascertainment of Excess/Shortfall.-  For the purpose of ascertaining whether \nor not there is an excess/shortfall on the prescribed Limits of an Advance \nAccount, the following types of transaction should not be taken into account : \n \n(a) erroneous or incorrect debits and credits; \n(b) debits and credits raised in adjustment  of erroneous or \nincorrect/entries; \n(c) debits raised for the transfer of profits F.R. 510; \n(d) credits necessary for the transf er of provision to meet working \nlosses \u2013  F.RR 511 & 512. \n \n(2) Variation of Limits.-  The Li mits prescribed for each Advance \nAccount are fixed with due regard to the capacity of the department \nconcerned, the scale of operations en visaged, and the extent to which the \nGovernment can provide funds for the expenses of the activity.  \nDepartments are therefore strictly  enjo ined to keep within the prescribed \nlimits and avoid excesses/shortfalls on them. \n \n \n ", "219": " \n                                                                                                                              2 26 \n \n         The Appropriation Act, however, empowers the Minister of Finance, \nwith the approval of the Government, to  vary or alter by Order, any of the \nLimits prescribed for an Advance Acco unt.  Any such Order takes effect \nfrom a date specified therein and should  be obtained in advance when it is \nknown that an excess/shortfall would o ccur on any prescribed  Limit.  If, \nfor any unavoidable reason, authority could not be obtained before an \nexcess/shortfall occurred, the application seeking an Order should \nexpressly indicate the date from which the Order should take effect.  Such \napplication must be received in the Treasury not later than December 31st \nof the Financial Year.  No such Order shall have effect unless it has been \napproved by Parliament by Resolution. \n \n Such applications, other than thos e relating to Advance Accounts in \nrespect of advances to Public O fficers, should be by a Cabinet \nMemorandum setting out clearly the reasons why the excess/shortfall \ncould not have been foreseen.  In the case of Advance Accounts in respect \nof Advance to Public Officers, such app lications should be in the form of a \nMemorandum addressed by the Minister  concerned to the Minister of \nFinance. \n (3) Unauthorised Excesses/Shortf alls on Limits.-  When an \nexcess/shortfall is not covered by au thority, it will be the subject of \ncomment by the Auditor-General. \n \n F.R. 504.

(1) Depreciation of the \nCapital Assets of the Activity, ascertained in terms of (2) below, should be annually \ncharged to the Profit and Loss Account and credited to a Depreciation Reserve Fund \nAccount.  Before the closing of Treasury B ooks for the financial year, the amount of this \ndepreciation will be remitted to the Treasury to the credit of \"General Deposit Account \u2013  \nDepreciation Reserve Fund\".  The amount so paid will be carried in the books of account \nof the activity as an asset and shown in the Balance Sheet.  The replacement of \ndepreciated assets will be met from the Deposi t Account.  It should be noted that any \npart of the Reserve created in respect of a pa rticular asset should normally be utilised for  \nreplacement of that asset only.

Insurance compa-nies act as financial intermediaries in that they invest the premiums they collect for providing this service. Insurance company size is usually measured by net premiums written, that is, premium revenues less amounts paid for reinsurance. There are three main insurance sectors: property/casualty, life/health and health insurance. Property/casualty (P/C) consists mainly of auto, home and commer-cial insurance. Life/health (L/H) consists mainly of life insurance and annuity products. Health insurance is offered by private health insurance companies and some L/H and P/C insurers, as well as by government programs such as Medicare.\nRegulation\nAll types of insurance are regulated by the states, with each state having its own set of statutes and rules. State insurance departments oversee insurer sol-vency, market conduct and, to a greater or lesser degree, review and rule on requests for rate increases for coverage. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners develops model rules and regulations for the industry, many of which must be approved by state legislatures. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, refers to continued state regulation of the insurance industry as being in the public interest. Under the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act, insurance activities\u2014whether conducted by banks, broker-dealers or insurers\u2014are regulated by the states. However, there have been, and continue to be, challenges to state regulation from some seg-ments of the federal government as well as from some financial services firms.\nInsuranceBasics", "8": "2  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tAccounting\nInsurers are required to use statutory accounting principles (SAP) when filing \nannual financial reports with state regulators and the Internal Revenue Service. SAP, which evolved to enhance the industry\u2019s financial stability, is more conservative than the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), established by the inde -\npendent Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly owned companies to report their financial results using GAAP rules. Insurers outside the United States use standards that dif -\nfer from SAP and GAAP. As global markets developed, the need for more uniform accounting standards became clear. In 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent international accounting standards setting organiza -\ntion, began work on a set of standards, called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that it hopes will be used around the world. Since 2001 over 100 countries have required or permitted the use of IFRS.\nIn 2007 the SEC voted to stop requiring non-U.S. companies that use IFRS \nto re-issue their financial reports for U.S. investors using GAAP. In 2008 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners began to explore ways to move from statutory accounting principles to IFRS. Also in 2008, the FASB and IASB undertook a joint project to develop a common and improved framework for financial reporting.\nDistribution\nProperty/casualty and life insurance policies were once sold almost exclusively by agents\u2014either by captive agents, representing one insurance company, or by independent agents, representing several companies. Insurance companies selling through captive agents and/or by mail, telephone or via the Internet are called \u201cdirect writers.\u201d However, the distinctions between direct writers and independent agency companies have been blurring since the 1990s, when insur-ers began to use multiple channels to reach potential customers. In addition, in the 1980s banks began to explore the possibility of selling insurance through independent agents, usually buying agencies for that purpose. Other distribu-tion channels include sales through professional organizations and through workplaces.Insurance Basics\nOverview", "9": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t3Auto Insurance Basics\nAuto insurance protects against financial loss in the event of an accident. It is a \ncontract between the policyholder and the insurance company. The policyhold-er agrees to pay the premium and the insurance company agrees to pay losses as defined in the policy.\nAuto insurance provides property, liability and medical coverage:\n\uf0a7\tProperty coverage pays for damage to, or theft of, the car.\n\uf0a7\tLiability coverage pays for the policyholder\u2019s legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage.\n\uf0a7\tMedical coverage pays for the cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses.\nMost states require drivers to have auto liability insurance before they can legal-ly drive a car. (Liability insurance pays the other driver\u2019s medical, car repair and other costs when the policyholder is at fault in an auto accident.) All states have laws that set the minimum amounts of insurance or other financial security drivers have to pay for the harm caused by their negligence behind the wheel if an accident occurs. Most auto policies are for six months to a year. A basic auto insurance policy is comprised of six different kinds of coverage, each of which is priced separately (see below).\n1. Bodily Injury Liability\nThis coverage applies to injuries that the policyholder and family members list-ed on the policy cause to someone else. These individuals are also covered when driving other peoples\u2019 cars with permission. As motorists in serious accidents may be sued for large amounts, drivers can opt to buy more than the state-required minimum to protect personal assets such as homes and savings.\n2. Medical Payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP)\nThis coverage pays for the treatment of injuries to the driver and passengers of the policyholder\u2019s car. At its broadest, PIP can cover medical payments, lost wages and the cost of replacing services normally performed by someone injured in an auto accident. It may also cover funeral costs.\n3. Property Damage Liability\nThis coverage pays for damage policyholders (or someone driving the car with their permission) may cause to someone else\u2019s property. Usually, this means damage to someone else\u2019s car, but it also includes damage to lamp posts, tele-phone poles, fences, buildings or other structures hit in an accident.Auto InsuranceInsurance Basics", "10": "4  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t4. Collision\nThis coverage pays for damage to the policyholder\u2019s car resulting from a col-lision with another car, an object or as a result of flipping over. It also covers damage caused by potholes. Collision coverage is generally sold with a deduct-ible of $250 to $1,000\u2014the higher the deductible, the lower the premium. Even if policyholders are at fault for an accident, collision coverage will reimburse them for the costs of repairing the car, minus the deductible. If the policyholder is not at fault, the insurance company may try to recover the amount it paid from the other driver\u2019s insurance company, a process known as subrogation. If the company is successful, policyholders will also be reimbursed for the deduct-ible.\n5. Comprehensive\nThis coverage reimburses for loss due to theft or damage caused by something other than a collision with another car or object, such as fire, falling objects, missiles, explosions, earthquakes, windstorms, hail, flood, vandalism and riots, or contact with animals such as birds or deer. Comprehensive insurance is usu-ally sold with a $100 to $300 deductible, though policyholders may opt for a higher deductible as a way of lowering their premium. Comprehensive insur-ance may also reimburse the policyholder if a windshield is cracked or shattered. Some companies offer separate glass coverage with or without a deductible. States do not require the purchase of collision or comprehensive coverage, but lenders may insist borrowers carry it until a car loan is paid off. It may also be a requirement of some dealerships if a car is leased.\n6. Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage\nUninsured motorist coverage will reimburse the policyholder, a member of the family or a designated driver if one of them is hit by an uninsured or a hit-and-run driver. Underinsured motorist coverage comes into play when an at-fault driver has insufficient insurance to pay for the other driver\u2019s total loss. This cov-erage will also protect a policyholder who is hit while a pedestrian.Insurance Basics\nAuto Insurance", "11": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t5Homeowners Insurance Basics\nHomeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters. It is a pack -\nage policy, which means that it covers both damage to property and liability, or \nlegal responsibility, for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets. Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insur-ers. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or as a separate policy. Most maintenance-related problems are the homeowners\u2019 responsibility.\nA standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of \ncoverage. They include:\n1. Coverage for the Structure of the Home\nThis part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disaster listed in the policy. It will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and tear. Most standard policies also cover structures that are not attached to a house such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo. Generally, these structures are cov-ered for about 10 percent of the total amount of insurance on the structure of the home.\n2. Coverage for Personal Belongings\nFurniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disaster. Most companies provide coverage for 50 to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on the structure of a home. This part of the policy includes off-premises coverage. This means that belongings are covered anywhere in the world, unless the poli-cyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. Expensive items like jewelry, furs and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are sto-len. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised value.\nTrees, plants and shrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insur-\nance\u2014generally up to about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, light-ning, explosion, vandalism, riot and even falling aircraft. They are not covered for damage by wind or disease.Homeowners InsuranceInsurance Basics", "12": "6  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t3. Liability Protection\nLiability coverage protects against the cost of lawsuits for bodily injury or prop-erty damage that policyholders or family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets. The liability portion of the policy pays for both the cost of defending the policyholder in court and any court awards\u2014up to the limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends to anywhere in the world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. However, experts recommend that homeowners purchase at least $300,000 worth of protection. An umbrella or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage, includ-ing claims for libel and slander, as well as higher liability limits, can be added to the policy. Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 for $1 mil-lion of additional liability protection.\nHomeowners policies also provide no-fault medical coverage. In the event \nthat someone is injured in a policyholder\u2019s home, the injured person can sim-ply submit medical bills to the policyholder\u2019s insurance company. In this way expenses are paid without a liability claim being filed. This coverage, however, does not pay the medical bills for the policyholder\u2019s own family or pets.\n4. Additional Living Expenses\nThis pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabit-able due to damage from a fire, storm or other insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals and other extra living expenses incurred while the home is being rebuilt. Coverage for additional living expenses differs from company to company. Many policies provide coverage for about 20 percent of the insurance on a house. The coverage can be increased for an additional premium. Some companies sell a policy that provides an unlimited amount of loss-of-use cover-age, but for a limited amount of time.\nAdditional living expense coverage also reimburses homeowners who rent \nout part of their home for the rent that would have been collected from a ten-ant if the home had not been destroyed.\nTypes of Homeowners Insurance Policies\nThere are several types of homeowners insurance policies that differ in the amount of insurance coverage they provide. The different types are fairly standard through -\nout the country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that are slightly different or go by other names such as \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cdeluxe.\u201d People who rent the homes they live in have specific renters policies.Insurance Basics\nHomeowners Insurance", "13": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t7The various types of homeowners insurance policies are listed below.\n\u2022 HO-3: This is the most common policy and protects the home from all \nperils except those specifically excluded.\n\u2022 HO-1: Limited coverage policyThis \u201cbare bones\u201d policy provides coverage against the first 10 disasters.

Full replacement cost policies may not be available for some older homes.\n\u2022 HO4: RenterCreated specifically for people who rent the home they live in, this policy protects personal possessions and any parts of the apartment that the policyholder owns, such as newly installed kitchen cabinets, against all 16 disasters.\n\u2022 H0-6: Condo/Co-opA policy for people who own a condo or co-op, it provides coverage for belongings and the structural parts of the building that they own.

Some of these exclusions are discussed below.\n1. Floods\nFlood damage is excluded under standard homeowners and renters insurance poli -\ncies. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers. Additional information on flood insurance can be found on the FloodSmart.gov Web site or by calling 888-379-9531. For coverage over and above the $250,000 limit for property and $100,000 for contents provided by the NFIP, excess flood insurance is available from private insurance companies. (See Topic on Flood Insurance on page 47 for further information.)\nTsunamis cause flood damage and are therefore only covered by a flood policy. \n2. EarthquakesEarthquake coverage can be a separate policy or an endorsement to a home-owners or renters policy. It is available from most insurance companies. In Insurance Basics\nHomeowners Insurance", "15": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t9California, it is also available from the California Earthquake Authority, a pri-\nvately funded, publically managed organization. In earthquake prone states like California, the policy comes with a high deductible.\n3. Damage Resulting from \u201cFaulty, Defective or Inadequate\u201d Maintenance, \nWorkmanship, Construction or MaterialsDefective products can include construction materials.  An insurance policy will not cover damage due to lack of maintenance, mold, termite infestation and infestation from other pests. It is the policyholder\u2019s responsibility to take rea-sonable precautions to protect the home from damage. \nLevels of Coverage\nThere are three coverage options.\n1. Actual Cash Value\nThis type of coverage pays to replace the home or possessions minus a deduc-tion for depreciation.\n2. Replacement Cost\nThis type of coverage pays the cost of rebuilding or repairing the home or replacing possessions without a deduction for depreciation.\n3. Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost\nAn extended replacement cost policy pays a certain percentage, generally 20-25 percent, over the coverage limit to rebuild the home in the event that materials and labor costs are pushed up by a widespread disaster, for example. For exam-ple, if homeowners take out a policy for $100,000, they can get up to an extra $20,000 or $25,000 of coverage.\nSome companies offer a guaranteed replacement cost policy, which pays \nwhatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster, even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally does not cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. However, an endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law can help pay for these additional costs.\nGuaranteed and extended replacement cost policies are more expensive; but \ncan offer excellent financial protection against disasters. This type of coverage, however, may not be available in all states or from all companies.Homeowners InsuranceInsurance Basics", "16": "10  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tBusiness Insurance Basics\nMost businesses need to purchase at least the following four types of insurance:\n1. Property Insurance\nProperty insurance compensates a business if the property used in the business is lost or damaged as the result of various types of common perils, such as fire or theft. Property insurance covers not just a building or structure but also the contents, including office furnishings, inventory, raw materials, machinery, computers and other items vital to a business\u2019s operations. Depending on the type of policy, property insurance may include coverage for equipment break-down, removal of debris after a fire or other destructive event, some types of water damage and other losses.\nBusiness Interruption Insurance\nAlso known as business income insurance, business interruption insurance is a type of property insurance. A business whose property has sustained a direct physical loss such as fire damage or a damaged roof due to a tree falling on it in a windstorm and has to close down completely while the premises are being repaired may lose out to competitors. A quick resumption of business after a disaster is essential. That is why business interruption insurance is so important.\nThere are typically three types of business interruption insurance. A business \ncan purchase any one or combination of these.\n\u2022\t Business\tIncome\tCoverage:\t Compensates for lost income if a company \nhas to vacate its premises due to disaster-related damage that is covered under the property insurance policy. Business income insurance covers the profits the company would have earned, based on financial records, had the disaster not occurred. The policy also covers operating expenses, such as electricity, that continue even though business activities have come to a temporary halt.\n\u2022\t Extra\tIncome\tCoverage:  Reimburses the company for a reasonable sum of \nmoney that it spends, over and above normal operating expenses, to avoid having to shut down during the restoration period.\n\u2022\t Contingent\tBusiness\tInterruption\tInsurance:  Protects a businessowner\u2019s \nearnings following physical loss or damage to the property of the insured\u2019s suppliers or customers, as opposed to its own property. \nDamage due to floods, earthquakes and acts of terrorism are generally not  covered by standard business property insurance but can be purchased through various markets.Insurance Basics\nBusiness Insurance", "17": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t11Protection Against Flood Damage\nProperty insurance policies usually exclude coverage for flood damage. \nBusinesses should find out from their local government office or commercial bank whether their business is located in a flood zone and whether their loca-tion has been flooded in the past. Flood insurance is available through the fed-eral government\u2019s National Flood Insurance Program (www.FloodSmart.gov), which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers.\nProtection Against Earthquake Damage\nCoverage for earthquake damage is excluded in most property insurance poli-\ncies, including businessowners package policies. Businesses in an earthquake-prone area will need a special earthquake insurance policy or commercial prop-erty earthquake endorsement.\nProtection Against Terrorist Attack Losses\nUnder the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and its extensions, only busi-\nnesses that purchase optional terrorism coverage are covered for losses arising from terrorist acts. The exception is workers compensation, which covers work-related injuries and deaths including those due to acts of terrorism.\n2. Liability Insurance\nAny enterprise can be sued. Customers may claim that the business caused them harm as the result of, for example, a defective product, an error in a service or disregard for another person\u2019s property. Or a claimant may allege that the busi-ness created a hazardous environment. Liability insurance pays damages for which the business is found liable, up to the policy limits, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and other legal defense expenses. It also pays the medical bills of any peo-ple injured by, or on the premises of, the business.\nA Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance policy is the first line of \ndefense against many common claims. CGL policies cover claims in four basic categories of business liability:\n\u2022 Bodily injury\n\u2022 Property damage\u2022 Personal injury (including slander or libel)\u2022 Advertising injury (damage from slander or false advertising)\nIn addition to covering claims listed above, CGL policies also cover the cost of \ndefending or settling claims. General liability insurance policies always state the maximum amount that the insurer will pay during the policy period. Business InsuranceInsurance Basics", "18": "12  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tThere are two major forms of liability insurance policies a business can select: \noccurrence and claims made. Both types of policies have their advantages.\n\u2022\t Occurrence\tPolicy: An occurrence policy covers a business for harm to \nothers caused by incidents that occurred while a policy is in force, no \nmatter when the claim is filed. For example, a person might sue a business in 2010 for an injury stemming from a fall in 1999. The policy that was in place when the incident occurred (i.e. 1999) will apply, even if the company now has a policy in place with higher limits. Occurrence coverage may not be available in some states or for some industries or professions.\n\u2022\t Claims\tMade\tPolicy:\t A claims made policy covers the business based on \nthe policy that is in force when the claim is made, regardless of when the incident occurred. In the above example, the limits in the policy in effect in 2010 would apply. Businesses with claims made policies can purchase optional \u201ctail coverage.\u201d Tail coverage enables a business to report claims after the policy has ended for alleged injuries that occurred while the policy was in effect.\n3. Commercial Vehicle Insurance\nA commercial auto policy provides coverage for vehicles that are used primar-ily in connection with commercial establishments or business activities. The insurance pays any costs to third parties resulting from bodily injury or property damage for which the business is legally liable up to the policy limits.  \nWhile the major coverages are the same, commercial auto policies differs \nfrom a personal auto policy in a number of technical respects. They may have higher limits and/or provisions that cover rented and other non-owned vehicles, including employees\u2019 cars driven for company business. Several insurers offer business auto policies geared to owners of small businesses or specific types of businesses.\n4. Workers Compensation Insurance\nEmployers have a legal responsibility to their employees to make the workplace safe. However, despite precautions, accidents can occur. To protect employers from lawsuits resulting from workplace accidents and to provide medical care and compensation for lost income to employees hurt in workplace accidents, in almost every state businesses are required by law to buy workers compensa-tion insurance. Workers compensation insurance covers workers injured on the job, whether they are hurt on the workplace premises or elsewhere, or in auto accidents while on business. It also covers work-related illnesses. Workers com-Insurance Basics\nBusiness Insurance", "19": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t13pensation provides payments to injured workers, without regard to who was at \nfault in the accident, for time lost from work and for medical and rehabilitation services. It also provides death benefits to surviving spouses and dependents. Each state has different laws governing the amount and duration of lost income benefits, the provision of medical and rehabilitation services and how the sys-tem is administered. For example, in most states there are regulations that cover whether the worker or employer can choose the doctor who treats the injuries and how disputes about benefits are resolved.\nWorkers compensation insurance must be bought as a separate policy. \nIn-home business and businessowners policies (BOPs) are sold as package poli-cies but do not include coverage for workers\u2019 injuries.\nOther Types of Business Coverages\nThe first four coverages discussed below are different types of liability insurance policies available to businesses. The fifth is a form of life insurance. There are also specialized liability policies geared to specific types of businesses.\n1. Errors and Omissions Insurance/Professional Liability\nSome businesses involve services such as giving advice, making recommenda-tions, designing things, providing physical care or representing the needs of others, which can lead to being sued by customers, clients or patients claiming that the business\u2019 failure to perform a job properly has injured them. Errors and omissions or professional liability insurance covers these situations. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy limit. It also provides legal defense costs, even when there has been no wrong-doing.\n2. Employment Practices Liability Insurance\nEmployment practices liability insurance covers, up to the policy limits, dam-ages for which an employer is legally liable such as violating an employee\u2019s civil or other legal rights. In addition to paying a judgment for which the insured is liable, it also provides legal defense costs, which can be substantial even when there has been no wrongdoing.\n3. Directors and Officers Liability Insurance\nDirectors and officers liability insurance protects directors and officers of corpo-rations or nonprofit organizations if there is a lawsuit claiming they managed the business or organization without proper regard for the rights of others. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the Business InsuranceInsurance Basics", "20": "14  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tpolicy limit. It also provides for legal defense costs, even where there has been \nno wrongdoing.\n4. Umbrella or Excess Policies\nAs the name implies, an umbrella liability policy provides coverage over and above a business\u2019s other liability coverages. It is designed to protect against unusually high losses, providing protection when the policy limits of one of the underlying policies have been used up. For a typical business, an umbrella poli-cy would provide protection beyond Its general liability and auto liability poli-cies. If a company has employment practices liability insurance, directors and officers liability, or other types of liability insurance, the umbrella could provide protection beyond those policy limits as well. Cost depends on the nature of the business, its size, the type of risks the business faces and the ways the business implements risk reduction.\n5. Key Person Life Insurance\nThe loss of a key person can be a major blow to a small business if that person is the founder of the business or is the key contact for customers and suppliers and the management of the business. Loss of the key person may also make the running of the business less efficient and result in a loss of capital. Losses caused by the death of a key employee are insurable. Such policies compensate the business against significant losses that result from that person\u2019s death or disabil-ity. The amount and cost of insurance needed for a particular business depends on the situation and the age, health and role of the key employee. Key employ-ee life insurance pays a death benefit to the company when the key employee dies. The policy is normally owned by the company, which pays the premiums and is the beneficiary. The monies from key person insurance can be used to buy back shares in a company from the estate of the deceased, pay a head hunt-ing firm to find a suitable replacement and cover costs or expenses while the business adjusts to the loss.\nPackage Policies\nCommercial insurers sell coverages separately and/or offer policies that combine protection from most major property and liability risks in one package. Package policies are created for types of businesses that generally face the same kind and degree of risk.\n1. Packages for Small Businesses\nSmaller companies often purchase a package policy known as the Business-Insurance Basics\nBusiness Insurance", "21": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t15owners Policy, or BOP. A BOP is recommended for most small businesses (usual-\nly 100 employees or less), as it is often the most affordable way to obtain broad coverage. BOPs are \u201coff the shelf\u201d policies combining many of the basic coverag-es needed by a typical small business into a standard package at a premium that is generally less than would be required to purchase these coverages separately. Combining both property and liability insurance, a BOP will cover a business in the event of property damage, suspended operations, lawsuits resulting from bodily injury or property damage to others, etc. BOPs do not cover professional liability, auto insurance, workers compensation or health and disability insur-ance. Small businesses will need separate insurance policies to cover professional services, vehicles and employees.\n2. Commercial Multiple Peril Policies\nLarger companies might purchase a commercial package policy or customize their policies to meet the special risks they face. Commercial multiple peril poli-cies, often purchased by corporations, bundle property, boiler and machinery, crime and general liability coverage together. Larger firms employee a risk man-ager to help determine the company\u2019s exposure to certain risks.\n3. In-Home Business Policies\nThere are several insurance options designed to address the special needs of home businesses. \n\u2022\t Homeowners\tPolicy\tEndorsement:  Homeowners may be able to add a \nsimple endorsement or rider to their existing homeowners policy to increase \ncoverage. \n\u2022\t In-Home\tBusiness\tPolicy:\t An in-home business policy provides more \ncomprehensive coverage for business equipment and liability than a homeowners policy endorsement. Many insurance companies offer insurance policies specifically tailored to small business. \n\u2022\t Businessowners\tPolicy\t(BOP): The home business might be eligible for \nThe Businessowners Policy (BOP), see above. The key to whether a business owner is eligible for a BOP is the size of the premises, the limits of liability required, the type of commercial operation it is and the extent of its off-premises servicing and processing activities. A BOP, like an in-home business policy, covers business property and equipment, loss of income, extra expense and liability; however, the BOP provides these coverages on a much broader scale.Business InsuranceInsurance Basics", "22": "16  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tLife Insurance Basics\nMany financial experts consider life insurance to be the cornerstone of sound \nfinancial planning. It can be an important tool in the following situations:\n1. Replace Income for Dependents\nIf people depend on an individual\u2019s income, life insurance can replace that income if the person dies. The most common example of this is parents with young children. Insurance to replace income can be especially useful if the  government- or employer-sponsored benefits of the surviving spouse or  domestic partner will be reduced after he or she dies.\n2. Pay Final Expenses\nLife insurance can pay funeral and burial costs, probate and other estate admin-istration costs, debts and medical expenses not covered by health insurance.\n3. Create an Inheritance for Heirs\nEven those with no other assets to pass on, can create an inheritance by buying a life insurance policy and naming their heirs as beneficiaries.\n4. Pay Federal \u201cDeath\u201d Taxes and State \u201cDeath\u201d Taxes\nLife insurance benefits can pay for estate taxes so that heirs will not have to liq-uidate other assets or take a smaller inheritance. Changes in the federal \u201cdeath\u201d tax rules through January 1, 2011 will likely lessen the impact of this tax on some people, but some states are offsetting those federal decreases with increas-es in their state-level estate taxes.\n5. Make Significant Charitable Contributions\nBy making a charity the beneficiary of their life insurance policies, individuals can make a much larger contribution than if they donated the cash equivalent of the policy\u2019s premiums.\n6. Create a Source of Savings\nSome types of life insurance create a cash value that, if not paid out as a death benefit, can be borrowed or withdrawn on the owner\u2019s request. Since most people make paying their life insurance policy premiums a high priority, buying a cash-value type policy can create a kind of \u201cforced\u201d savings plan. Furthermore, the interest credited is tax deferred (and tax exempt if the money is paid as a death claim).Insurance Basics\nLife Insurance", "23": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t17Types of Life Insurance\nThere are two major types of life insurance: term and whole life.\n1. Term Life\nTerm insurance is the simplest form of life insurance. It pays only if death occurs during the term of the policy, which is usually from one to 30 years. Most term policies have no other benefit provisions. There are two basic types of term life insurance policies: level term and decreasing term. Level term means that the death benefit stays the same throughout the duration of the policy. Decreasing term means that the death benefit drops, usually in one-year incre-ments, over the course of the policy\u2019s term.\n2. Whole Life/Permanent Life\nWhole life or permanent insurance pays a death benefit whenever the policy-holder dies. There are three major types of whole life or permanent life insur-ance\u2014traditional whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, and there are variations within each type.\nIn the case of traditional whole life, both the death benefit and the premi-\num are designed to stay the same (level) throughout the life of the policy. The cost per $1,000 of benefit increases as the insured person ages, and it obviously gets very high when the insured lives to 80 and beyond. The insurance com-pany keeps the premium level by charging a premium that, in the early years, is higher than what is needed to pay claims, investing that money, and then using it to supplement the level premium to help pay the cost of life insurance for older people.\nBy law, when these \u201coverpayments\u201d reach a certain amount, they must be \navailable to the policyholder as a cash value if he or she decides not to continue with the original plan. The cash value is an alternative, not an additional, ben-efit under the policy. In the 1970s and 1980s, life insurance companies intro-duced two variations on the traditional whole life product: universal life insur-ance and variable universal life insurance.\nSome varieties of whole life/permanent life insurance are discussed below.\n\u2022\t Universal\tLife:  Universal life, also known as adjustable life, allows more \nflexibility than traditional whole life policies. The savings vehicle (called a \ncash value account) generally earns a money market rate of interest. After money has accumulated in the account, the policyholder will also have the option of altering premium payments\u2014providing there is enough money in the account to cover the costs.Life InsuranceInsurance Basics", "24": "18  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t\u2022\t Variable\tLife: Variable life policies combine death protection with a \nsavings account that can be invested in stocks, bonds and money market \nmutual funds. The value of the policy may grow more quickly, but involves more risk. If investments do not perform well, the cash value and death benefit may decrease. Some policies, however, guarantee that the death  benefit will not fall below a minimum level. \n\u2022\t Variable\tUniversal\tLife:  This type of policy combines the features of \nvariable and universal life policies, including the investment risks and rewards characteristic of variable life insurance and the ability to adjust  premiums and the death benefit that is characteristic of universal life  insurance.Insurance Basics\nLife Insurance", "25": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t19Annuities Basics\nAnnuities are financial products intended to enhance retirement security. An \nannuity is an agreement for one person or organization to pay another a series of payments. Usually the term \u201cannuity\u201d relates to a contract between an indi-vidual and a life insurance company.\nThere are many categories of annuities. They can be classified by:\n\u2022\t Nature\tof\tthe\tunderlying\tinvestment:\t fixed or variable\n\u2022\t Primary\tpurpose:\t accumulation or pay-out (deferred or immediate)\n\u2022\t Nature\tof\tpayout\tcommitment:\t fixed period, fixed amount or lifetime\n\u2022\t Tax\tstatus:\t qualified or nonqualified\n\u2022\t Premium\tpayment\tarrangement:\t single premium or flexible premium\nAn annuity can be classified in several of these categories at once. For example, an individual might buy a nonqualified single premium deferred variable annuity.\nIn general, annuities have the following features:\n1. Tax Deferral on Investment EarningsMany investments are taxed year by year, but the investment earnings\u2014capital gains and investment income\u2014in annuities are not taxable until the investor withdraws money. This tax deferral is also true of 401(k)s and IRAs; however, unlike these products, there are no limits on the amount one can put into an annuity. Moreover, the minimum withdrawal requirements for annuities are much more liberal than they are for 401(k)s and IRAs.\n2. Protection from Creditors\nPeople who own an immediate annuity (that is, who are receiving money from an insurance company), are afforded some protection from creditors. Generally the most that creditors can access is the payments as they are made, since the money the annuity owner gave the insurance company now belongs to the company. Some state statutes and court decisions also protect some or all of the payments from those annuities.\n3. A Variety of Investment Options\nMany annuity companies offer an array of investment options. For example, individuals can invest in a fixed annuity that credits a specified interest rate, similar to a bank Certificate of Deposit (CD). If they buy a variable annuity, their money can be invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds. In recent years, annuity companies have created various types of \u201cfloors\u201d that limit the extent of investment decline from an increasing reference point.AnnuitiesInsurance Basics", "26": "20  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t4. Taxfree Transfers Among Investment Options\nIn contrast to mutual funds and other investments made with aftertax money, with annuities there are no tax consequences if owners change how their funds are invested. This can be particularly valuable if they are using a strategy called \u201crebalancing,\u201d which is recommended by many financial advisors. Under rebal-ancing, investors shift their investments periodically to return them to the proportions that represent the risk/return combination most appropriate for the investor\u2019s situation.\n5. Lifetime Income\nA lifetime immediate annuity converts an investment into a stream of pay-ments that last until the annuity owner dies. In concept, the payments come from three \u201cpockets\u201d: The original investment, investment earnings and money from a pool of people in the investors group who do not live as long as actuarial tables forecast. The pooling is unique to annuities, and it is what enables annu-ity companies to be able to guarantee a lifetime income.\n6. Benefits to Heirs\nThere is a common apprehension that if an individual starts an immediate lifetime annuity and dies soon after that, the insurance company keeps all of the investment in the annuity. To prevent this situation individuals can buy a \u201cguaranteed period\u201d with the immediate annuity. A guaranteed period commits the insurance company to continue payments after the owner dies to one or more designated beneficiaries; the payments continue to the end of the stated guaranteed period\u2014usually 10 or 20 years (measured from when the owner started receiving the annuity payments). Moreover, annuity benefits that pass to beneficiaries do not go through probate and are not governed by the annuity owner\u2019s will.\nTypes of Annuities\nThere are two major types of annuities: fixed and variable. Fixed annuities guar -\nantee the principal and a minimum rate of interest. Generally, interest credited and payments made from a fixed annuity are based on rates declared by the company, which can change only yearly. Fixed annuities are considered \u201cgeneral account\u201d assets. In contrast, variable annuity account values and payments are based on the performance of a separate investment portfolio, thus their value may fluctuate daily. Variable annuities are considered \u201cseparate account\u201d assets.\nThere are a variety of fixed annuities and variable annuities. One example, \nthe equity indexed annuity, is a hybrid of the features of fixed and variable Insurance Basics\nAnnuities", "27": "I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t21annuities. It credits a minimum rate of interest, just as other fixed annuities do, \nbut its value is also based on the performance of a specified stock index\u2014usu-ally computed as a fraction of that index\u2019s total return. In December 2008 the Securities and Exchange Commission voted to reclassify indexed annuities (with some exceptions) as securities, not insurance products. Annuities can also be classified by marketing channel, in other words whether they are sold to groups or individuals.\nAnnuities can be deferred or immediate. Deferred annuities generally accu-\nmulate assets over a long period of time, with withdrawals usually as a single sum or as an income payment beginning at retirement. Immediate annuities allow purchasers to convert a lump sum payment into a stream of income that the policyholder begins to receive right away.AnnuitiesInsurance Basics", "28": "22  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tLong-Term Care Insurance Basics\nLong-term care insurance pays for services to help individuals who are unable to \nperform certain activities of daily living without assistance, or require supervi-sion due to a cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nFeatures of Long-Term Care Policies\nThe best policies pay for care in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or at home. Benefits are typically expressed in daily amounts, with a lifetime maxi-mum. Some policies pay half as much per day for at-home care as for nursing home care. Others pay the same amount, or have a \u201cpool of benefits\u201d that can be used as needed.\nCriteria for the Beginning of Payments\nThe policy should state the various conditions that must be met. They can include:\n1. The Inability to Perform Two or Three Specific \u201cActivities of Daily Living\u201d \nWithout HelpThese include bathing, dressing, eating, toileting and \u201ctransferring\u201d or being able to move from place to place or between a bed and a chair.\n2. Cognitive Impairment\nMost policies cover stroke and Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, but other forms of mental incapacity may be excluded.\n3. Medical Necessity or Certification by a Doctor that Long-Term Care is \nNecessaryMost policies have a \u201cwaiting period\u201d or \u201celimination\u201d period. This is a period that begins when an individual first needs long-term care and lasts as long as the policy provides. During the waiting period, the policy will not pay benefits. The policy pays only for expenses that occur after the waiting period is over, if the policyholder continues to need care. In general, the longer the waiting period, the lower the premium for the long-term care policy.\nBenefit periods for long-term care may range from two years to a lifetime. \nPremiums can be kept down by electing coverage for three to four years\u2014longer than the average nursing home stay\u2014instead of a lifetime.\nMost long-term care policies pay on a reimbursement (or expense-incurred) \nbasis, up to the policy limits. In other words, if the policy has a $150 per day benefit, but the policyholder spends only $130 per day for a home long-term care provider, the policy will pay only $130. The \u201cextra\u201d $20 each day will, in Insurance Basics\nLong-Term Care Insurance", "29": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t23some policies, go into a \u201cpool\u201d of unused funds that can be used to extend the \nlength of time for which the policy will pay benefits. Other policies pay on an indemnity basis. Using the same example as above, an indemnity policy would pay $150 per day as long as the insured needs and receives long-term care ser-vices, regardless of the actual outlay.\nInflation protection is an important feature, especially for people under the \nage of 65, who are buying benefits that they may not use for 20 years or more. A good inflation provision compounds benefits at 5 percent a year. Without inflation protection, even 3 percent annual inflation will, over 24 years, reduce the purchasing power of a $150 daily benefit to the equivalent of $75.\nSix Other Important Policy Provisions\n1. Elimination PeriodUnder some policies, if the insured has qualifying long-term care expenses  on one day during a seven-day period, he or she will be credited with having satisfied seven days toward the elimination period: i.e., the time between an injury and the receipt of payments. This type of provision reflects the way  home care is often delivered\u2014some days by professionals and some days by family members.\n2. Guaranteed Renewable Policies\nThese must be renewed by the insurance company, although premiums can go up if they are increased for an entire class of policyholders.\n3. Waiver of Premium\nThis provision ensures that no further premiums are due once the policyholder starts to receive benefits.\n4. Third-Party Notification\nThis provision stipulates that a relative, friend or professional adviser will be notified if the policyholder forgets to pay a premium.\n5. Nonforfeiture Benefits\nThese benefits keep a lesser amount of insurance in force if the policyholder lets the coverage lapse. This provision is required by some states.\n6. Restoration of Benefits\nThis provision ensures that maximum benefits are put back in place if the policyholder receives benefits for a time, then recovers and goes for a specified period (typically six months) without receiving benefits.Long-Term Care InsuranceInsurance Basics", "30": "24  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t 24Disability Insurance Basics\nDisabling injuries affect millions of Americans each year. Disability insurance, \nwhich complements health insurance, helps replace lost income if an individual is unable to work due to a disability.\nThere are three basic ways to replace income.\n1. Employer-Paid Disability InsuranceThis is required in most states. Most employers provide some short-term sick leave. Many larger employers provide long-term disability coverage as well, typi-cally with benefits of up to 60 percent of salary lasting for a period of up to five years until the age of 65, and in some cases extended for life.\n2. Social Security Disability Benefits\nThis is paid to workers whose disability is expected to last at least 12 months and is so severe that no gainful employment can be expected.\n3. Individual Disability Income Insurance Policies\nOther limited replacement income is available for workers under some circum-stances from workers compensation (if the injury or illness is job-related), auto insurance (if disability results from an auto accident) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. For most workers, even those with some employer-paid cover-age, an individual disability income policy is the best way to ensure adequate income in the event of disability. Workers who buy a private disability income policy can expect to replace from 50 percent to 70 percent of income. Disability benefits paid out on individual disability policies are not taxed; benefits from employer-paid policies are subject to income tax.\nTypes of Disability Insurance\nThere are two types of disability policies: Short-term disability and Long-term disability. Short-term policies have a waiting period of 0 to 14 days with a maximum benefit period of no longer than two years. Long-term policies have a waiting period of several weeks to several months with a maximum benefit period ranging from a few years to a lifetime.\nDisability policies have two different protection features: noncancelable and \nguaranteed renewable. Noncancelable means that the policy cannot be canceled by the insurance company, except for nonpayment of premiums. This gives the policyholder the right to renew the policy every year without an increase in the premium or a reduction in benefits. Guaranteed renewable gives the policyhold-er the right to renew the policy with the same benefits and not have the policy Insurance Basics\nDisability Insurance", "31": "\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t25 25canceled by the company. However, the insurer has the right to increase premi-\nums as long as it does so for all other policyholders in the same rating class.\nThere are several options and factors to consider when purchasing a disabil-\nity policy.\n1. Additional Purchase Options\nThe insurance company gives the policyholder the right to buy additional insur-ance at a later time.\n2. Coordination of Benefits\nThe amount of benefits policyholders receive from their insurance companies is dependent on other benefits they receive because of the disability. The policy specifies a target amount the policyholder will receive from all the policies com-bined and will make up the difference not paid by other policies.\n3. Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) \nThe COLA increases disability benefits over time based on the increased cost of living measured by the Consumer Price Index. Policyholders will pay a higher premium if they select the COLA.\n4. Residual or Partial Disability Rider\nThis provision allows workers to return to work part-time, collecting part of their salaries and receiving a partial disability payment if they are still partially disabled.\n5. Return of Premium\nThis provision requires the insurance company to refund part of the premium if no claims are made for a specific period of time declared in the policy.\n6. Waiver of Premium Provision\nThis clause means that the policyholder does not have to pay premiums on the policy after he or she is disabled for 90 days.\nFactors Affecting the Choice of a Disability Policy\n1. Definition of DisabilitySome policies pay benefits if workers are unable to perform the customary duties of their own occupation. Others pay only if workers are unable to perform any job suitable for their level of education and experience. Some policies define disability in terms of workers\u2019 occupations for an initial period of two or three years and then continue to pay benefits only if they are unable to perform any occupation. \u201cOwn occupation\u201d policies are more desirable, but more expensive.Disability InsuranceInsurance Basics", "32": "26  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t2. Benefit Period\nThe benefit period is the amount of time policyholders will receive monthly benefits during their lifetimes. Experts usually recommend that the policy pay benefits until at least age 65, at which point Social Security disability will take over. Young people may consider buying a policy offering lifetime benefits because it will still be relatively inexpensive.\n3. Replacement Percentage\nA policy that will replace from 60 percent to 70 percent of total taxable earnings is advisable. A higher replacement percentage, if available, is more expensive. Other sources of income should be evaluated before deciding how much disabil-ity coverage is needed.\n4. Coverage for Disability Resulting from Either Accidental Injury or Illness\nAn accident-only policy is less expensive but does not provide adequate protec-tion. Ideally, both accident and illness coverage should be purchased.\n5. A Cost-of-Living Increase in Benefits\nPolicies may not pay benefits for a decade or more and should keep pace with increases in the cost of living. (Some companies also offer \u201cindexed\u201d benefits, keeping pace with inflation after benefit payments begin.)\n6. A Policy Paying \u201cResidual\u201d or Partial Benefits\nThis type of policy is available so that people can work part-time and still receive a benefit making up for lost income. A standard feature in some policies, and added by a rider to others, a residual benefits policy pays partial benefits based on loss of income without an initial period of total disability.\n7. Transition Benefits\nOffered by some companies, it can offset financial loss during a post-disability period of rebuilding a business or professional practice.\n8. Ongoing Coverage\nA noncancelable policy will continue in-force as long as the premiums are paid; neither the benefit nor the premium can change. A guaranteed renewable policy keeps the same benefits but may cost more over time since the insurer can increase the premium if it is increased for an entire class of policyholders. \n9.

These so-called alternative risk transfer (ART) arrangements blend risk transfer and risk retention mechanisms and, together with self insurance, form the alternative market.\nCaptives\u2014a special type of insurance company set up by a parent company, \ntrade association or group of companies to insure the risks of its owner or own-ers\u2014and risk-retention groups\u2014in which entities in a common industry join together to provide members with liability insurance\u2014were the first mecha-nisms to appear. Other options, including risk retention pools and large deduct-ible plans, a form of self insurance, followed. \nART products, such as catastrophe bonds, weather derivatives and micro-\ninsurance programs are also emerging as an alternative to traditional insurance and reinsurance products. \nAlternative Market Mechanisms\nI. CaptivesWholly owned captives are companies set up by large corporations to finance or administer their risk financing needs. If such a captive insures only the risks of its parent or subsidiaries it is called a \u201cpure\u201d captive.\nCaptives may be established to provide insurance to more than one entity. \nAn association or group of companies may band together to form a captive to provide insurance coverage. Professionals\u2014doctors, lawyers, accountants\u2014have formed many captives over the years. Captives may, in turn, use a variety of reinsurance mechanisms to provide the coverage. In particular, many offshore captives use a \u201cfronting\u201d insurer to provide the basic insurance policy. Fronting typically means that underwriting, claims and administrative functions are handled in the United States by an experienced commercial insurance company, since a captive generally will not want to get involved directly in running the insurance operation. Also, fronting allows a company to show it has an insur-", "36": "30  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nCaptives and Other Risk-Financing Options\nance policy with a U.S.-licensed insurance company, which it may need to do \nfor legal and business reasons.\nThe rent-a-captive concept was introduced in Bermuda 20 years ago and \nremains a popular alternative market mechanism. Rent-a-captives serve busi-nesses that are unable to capitalize a captive but are willing to assume a portion of their own risk and share in the underwriting profits and investment income. Generally sponsored by insurers or reinsurers, which essentially \u201crent out\u201d their capital for a fee, the mechanism allows users to obtain some of the advantages of a captive without having the expense of setting up a single parent captive and meeting minimum capital and surplus requirements.\nCaptives have been expanding into the employee benefits arena since \n2003, the year in which the Department of Labor gave final approval to Archer Daniels Midland Co.\u2019s plan to use its Vermont captive to reinsure group life insurance benefits.\nWhile the leading domicile for captives in the U.S. is Vermont, offshore \ncaptives covering U.S. risks are predominantly located in Bermuda, where they enjoy tax advantages and relative freedom from regulation. The Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg and Barbados are also significant centers for captives. Vermont is the leading domicile for captives in the United States.\nII. Self Insurance\nSelf insurance can be undertaken by single companies wishing to retain risk or by entities in similar industries or geographic locations that pool resources to insure each other\u2019s risks.\nThe use of higher retentions/deductibles is increasing in most lines of insur-\nance. In workers compensation many companies are opting to retain a larger portion of their exposure through policies with large deductible amounts of $100,000 or higher. Large deductible programs, which were first introduced in 1989, now account for a sizable portion of the market.\nIII. Risk Retention Groups\nA risk retention group (RRG) is a corporation owned and operated by its mem-bers. It must be chartered and licensed as a liability insurance company under the laws of at least one state. The group can then write insurance in all other states. It need not obtain a license in a state other than its chartering states.

Risk Purchasing Groups\nLike risk retention groups (RRGs), purchasing groups must be made up of per-sons or entities with like exposures and in a common business. However, where-as RRGs are liability insurance companies owned by their members, purchasing groups purchase liability coverage for their members from admitted insurers, surplus lines carriers or RRGs. Laws in some states prohibit insurers from giv-ing groups formed to purchase insurance advantages over individuals. However, purchasing groups are not subject to so-called \u201cfictitious group\u201d laws, which require a group to have been in existence for a certain period of time or require a group to have a certain minimum number of members. The Risk Retention Act of 1986 specifically provided for purchasing groups to be created to pur-chase liability insurance for members of the sponsoring groups.\nV. Catastrophe Bonds and other Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) Products\nA number of alternative risk transfer (ART) products, such as insurance-linked securities and weather derivatives have developed to meet the financial risk transfer needs of businesses. One such product, catastrophe (cat) bonds, risk-based securities sold via the capital markets, developed in the wake of hurri-canes Andrew and Iniki in 1992 and the Northridge earthquake in 1994\u2014mega-catastrophes that resulted in a global shortage of reinsurance (insurance for insurers) for such disasters. Tapping into the capital markets allowed insurers to diversify their risk and expand the amount of insurance available in catas-trophe-prone areas. Zurich Financial\u2019s Kamp Re was the first major catastrophe bond to be triggered. The $190 million bond was triggered by 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina, and resulted in a total loss of principal. Catastrophe bonds are now a multibillion dollar industry.", "38": "32  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nCatastrophes: Insurance Issues\nCatastrophes: Insurance Issues\nThe term \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in the property insurance industry denotes a natural or \nman-made disaster that is unusually severe. An event is designated a catastrophe by the industry when claims are expected to reach a certain dollar threshold, currently set at $25 million, and more than a certain number of policyholders and insurance companies are affected.\nThe magnitude of the damage caused by Katrina and the potential dam-\nage Hurricane Rita might have caused had it not weakened from an intense Category 5 hurricane has triggered a reexamination, not just among insurers and reinsurers but also among public policy and political leaders, of how the United States deals with the financial consequences of such massive property damage and personal loss.\nDisaster losses along the coast are likely to escalate in the coming years, \nin part because of huge increases in development. One catastrophe modeling company predicts that catastrophe losses will double every decade or so due to growing residential and commercial density and more expensive buildings. Data from the Census Bureau, collected by USA Today, show that in 2006, 34.9 million people were seriously threatened by Atlantic hurricanes, compared with 10.2 million in 1950. Before the 2005 hurricane season, Hurricane Andrew ranked as the single most costly U.S. natural disaster.\nMan-made catastrophes such as the attacks on the World Trade Center \ncan also cause huge losses. The attacks led Congress to pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in November 2002. Since then, TRIA has been reauthorized twice. The latest reauthorization, passed at the end of 2007, extends the law to 2014. TRIA provides a federal backstop for commercial insurance losses from terrorist acts, making it easier for insurers to calculate their maximum losses for such a catastrophe and thus to underwrite the coverage, see the topic on Terrorism Risk and Insurance.\nThe typical homeowners insurance policy covers damage from a fire, \nwindstorms, hail, riots and explosions\u2014as well as other types of loss such as theft and the cost of living elsewhere while the structure is being repaired or rebuilt after being damaged. Commercial property insurance policies generally cover the same causes of loss with some variation, depending on the coverages selected. Flood and earthquake damage are excluded under homeowners poli-cies\u2014separate policies are available\u2014but are covered under the comprehensive portion of the standard auto policy, which more than 75 percent of drivers who buy auto liability insurance purchase.\nThe insurance industry tracks catastrophes to monitor claim costs, assign-", "39": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updatesI.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t33Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nCatastrophes: Insurance Issues\ning a number to each catastrophe. Each claim arising from the event is tagged \nso that total industrywide losses can be tabulated. The term catastrophe is often used in the property insurance industry in a narrow way to mean a catastrophic event that exceeds a dollar threshold in claims payouts. This figure has changed over the years with inflation and the increase in development of areas subject to natural disasters. Starting in 1997 the catastrophe definition was raised from $5 million to $25 million in insured damage.\nThere have been four catastrophes that fall into the megacatastrophe catego-\nry, greatly exceeding the $25 million threshold. The first two, Hurricane Andrew (1992) and the Northridge earthquake (1994), were both watershed events in that they were far more destructive than most experts had predicted a disaster of this type would be. The third, the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, altered insurers\u2019 attitudes about man-made risks worldwide. Hurricane Katrina (2005), the fourth catastrophe, is not only the most expensive natural disaster on record but also an event that intensified discussion nationwide about the way disasters, natural and man-made, are managed. It also focused attention on the federal flood insurance program, see the topic on Flood Insurance.", "40": "34  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nCellphones and Driving\nCellphones and Driving \nIncreased reliance on cellphones has led to a rise in the number of people who \nuse the devices while driving. There are two dangers associated with driving and cellphone use, including text messaging. First, drivers must take their eyes off the road while dialing. Second, people can become so absorbed in their conversations that their ability to concentrate on the act of driving is severely impaired, jeopardizing the safety of vehicle occupants and pedestrians. Since the first law was passed in New York in 2001 banning hand-held cellphone use while driving, there has been debate as to the exact nature and degree of hazard. The latest research shows that while using a cellphone when driving may not be the most dangerous distraction, because it is so prevalent it is by far the most common distraction in crashes and near crashes.\nResearch:  Studies about cellphone use while driving have focused on several \ndifferent aspects of the problem. Some have looked at its prevalence as the lead-ing cause of driver distraction. Others have looked at the different risks associat-ed with hand-held and hands-free devices. Still others have focused on the seri-ousness of injuries in crashes involving cellphone users and the demographics of drivers who use cellphones. Of increasing concern is the practice of texting.\nIn January 2010 the National Safety Council (NSC) released a report that \nestimates that at least 1.6 million crashes (28 percent of all crashes) are caused each year by drivers talking on cellphones (1.4 million crashes) and texting (200,000 crashes). The estimate is based on data of driver cellphone use from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and from peer-reviewed research that quantifies the risks using cellphones and texting while driving. \nIn July 2009 Virginia Tech Transportation Institute released a study show-\ning that the risk of texting while driving is far greater than previous estimates showed and far exceeds the hazards associated with other driving distractions. Researchers used cameras in the cabs of trucks traveling long distances over a period of 18 months and found that the collision risk became 23 times higher when the drivers were texting. The research also measured the time drivers stopped looking at the road and used their eyes to send or receive texts. Drivers generally spent nearly five seconds looking at their devices before a crash or near crash, a period long enough for a vehicle to travel more than 100 yards at typical highway speeds.", "41": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t35Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nClimate Change: Insurance Issues\nClimate Change: Insurance Issues\nThere is now a consensus among the scientific community that the climate \nis changing, with potential risk to the global economy, ecology, and human health and well being. But how much of this is due to natural phenomena and how much to the effects of human activity is a matter of debate. Also unknown is the extent to which weather patterns have already been affected.\nAs assumers of risk, insurers seek to mitigate potential losses every day \nthrough a process known as risk management. Since climate change could lead to losses on a scale never before experienced, insurers are not waiting for researchers to produce all the answers. A 2009 report by Ceres, a network of companies concerned about global warming, identified some 244 insurance-related organizations in 29 countries that were working in 2008 to find solu-tions to the threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions, up from 190 groups in 26 countries in 2007. Insurers are also redoubling their efforts in the more traditional areas of risk management, including alerting policyholders to the potential for lawsuits for failure to protect against or disclose possible harm to the environment.\nMeanwhile, society\u2019s concern about climate change offers insurers new ave-\nnues for leadership and new opportunities for innovative products.\nGlobal Warming: When fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil and natural gas\u2014are burned to \nproduce energy, so-called greenhouse gases, largely carbon dioxide, are emitted into the atmosphere where they trap heat. Forests and oceans can absorb some of the carbon. But to avoid the most catastrophic effects of what is predicted to occur, researchers say, carbon emissions must be greatly reduced, hence the push to reduce overall energy use, boost the use of energy from renewable sources such as solar heat and curb the use of paper and other products made from trees, which absorb carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis.\nGlobal warming has the potential to affect most segments of the insurance \nbusiness, including life insurance if rising temperatures lead to an up-tick in death rates. Property losses of all kinds are most likely to increase, and there is \nthe potential for much higher commercial liability losses if shareholders and consumers try to hold businesses responsible for changes to the environment.\nInsurers\u2019 Contribution to Lowering Greenhouse Gases: Insurers, like compa-\nnies in other industries, are promoting strategies to lower greenhouse gas emis-\nsions. Some insurers have been warning public policy leaders and the general public about the threat of climate change for years, and others were among the ", "42": "36  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nClimate Change: Insurance Issues\nfirst to adopt public statements on the environment and climate change and to \njoin business coalitions calling on the federal government to enact legislation to reduce greenhouse gases. Some, particularly reinsurers, are sponsoring research and working with others interested in the same kind of solutions, such as find-ing ways for individuals and society to adapt to extreme weather, particularly in developing countries.\nMany insurance companies are committed to reducing their own total \ngreenhouse gas emissions and offsetting the remainder through contributions to reforestation and renewable energy projects. They also encourage their employ-ees to adopt \u201cgreen\u201d policies in their private lives. Some were involved in proj-ects to reduce greenhouse gases even before such efforts gained widespread pub-lic attention, and many are now reinforcing their policyholders\u2019 desire to reduce their carbon footprints by offering them paperless billing and documentation. Some have upgraded the quality of their Web sites to encourage policyholders to transact business electronically. At least one auto insurer sells policies exclu-sively online.\nInsurers are also working on another front: seeking to reduce the incidence \nand cost of property damage caused by those events that still occur, despite soci-ety\u2019s best efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.\nNew Products and Business Opportunities : Without insurance the economy \ncould not function. Insurers essentially enable new products and services to be created by assuming the risk of loss. Just as they quickly adapted existing liability insurance policies for horse-drawn carriages, or teams of horses, to auto-mobiles towards the end of the nineteenth century, so they are responding to climate change initiatives at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\nOpportunities exist on several fronts. First, there are new risks to insure, \nincluding new industries such as wind farms and other alternative fuel facilities, and emerging financial risks such as those involved in carbon trading. Insurance policies related to carbon trading protect those that invest in clean technol-ogy projects against failure of the project to deliver the agreed-upon emission rights. A number of companies are also offering their clients carbon project risk management consulting services. A carbon credit permits the holder to emit one ton of carbon. The Kyoto Protocol and other cap and trade systems now under discussion set ceilings for carbon output and allow those that produce less than the limit to sell credits to those that exceed it. Investors in clean technology projects such as reforestation and renewable energy buy the rights to credits and sell them in the international carbon trading market.

These include discounts on auto insurance policies for owning a hybrid car and for driving fewer miles and policies for green building construction.\nAuto Insurance Initiatives:  Motor vehicles account for more than 25 percent \nof all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Insurance policies such as pay-as-you-drive, which factors mileage driven into the price of insurance, and hybrid car discounts could reduce that amount by more than 10 percent if broadly imple-mented, according to Ceres, a network of companies concerned about global warming. A study by the Brookings Institution suggests that if drivers paid by the mile, driving would drop by about 8 percent.\nThere are two ways to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with \ndriving. One is to encourage people to purchase vehicles that emit less carbon dioxide into the environment and get more miles per gallon of gasoline. A number of companies offer discounts to people who drive hybrid vehicles\u2014some believe that people who are socially responsible are also more responsible behind the wheel. The other way is to reward people for driving fewer miles, known as pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) auto insurance. Several insurers have devel-oped technology-based discount programs that provide financial incentives to drive fewer miles. Mileage information comes from a special device. In some, it is linked to the car\u2019s odometer and in others it is a wireless sensor that can monitor speed as well as mileage. These programs are offered in a growing num-ber of states. In addition, California and several other states are encouraging the development of PAYD programs.\nInsurers are helping to promote sustainable building practices by offering \ngreen homeowners and commercial property policies. In addition, they are responding to the growing demand for assistance with energy and emissions-reduction projects with risk management services that address global warming.\n\u201cGreen\u201d Building Insurance Coverage:   Increasingly, homeowners at the lead-\ning edge of the environmental sustainability movement are generating their own geothermal, solar or wind power and selling any surplus energy back to the local power grid. Several insurers are supporting this trend by offering a homeowners policy that covers both the income lost when there is a power ", "44": "38  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nClimate Change: Insurance Issues\noutage from a covered peril and the extra expense to the homeowner of buying \nelectricity from another source. Policies generally cover the cost of getting back online, such as utility charges for inspection and reconnection.\nSome insurers offer homeowners insurance policies that, in the event of a \nfire or other disaster, allow policyholders to rebuild to environmentally respon-sible \u201cgreen\u201d standards, even if they had not purchased such a policy originally. Green standards, part of the sustainability movement, include energy conserva-tion benchmarks and the use of renewable construction materials. The Green Building Council introduced its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program in 2001. According to Ceres, buildings account for more than one-third of greenhouse gas emissions and green building practices can reduce energy use and emissions by more than 50 percent.\nWith green commercial building construction expected to rise significantly \nover the next few years, a growing number of insurers are offering green com-mercial property insurance policies and endorsements, some of which are direct-ed at specific segments of the business community such as manufacturers. The first green commercial policy was introduced in 2006.\nIn general, the policies allow building owners to replace damaged buildings, \nwhether or not they are already certified green, with green alternatives includ-ing energy efficient electrical equipment and interior lighting, water conserving plumbing, and nontoxic and low odor paints and carpeting. They also may pay for engineering inspections of heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems, building recertification fees, the replacement of vegetative or plant covered roofs and debris recycling. Some cover the income lost and costs incurred when alter-native energy generating equipment is damaged.", "45": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t39Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nCredit Scoring\nCredit Scoring\nThe goal of every insurance company is to correlate rates for insurance policies \nas closely as possible with the actual cost of claims. If insurers set rates too high they will lose market share to competitors who have more accurately matched rates to expected costs. If they set rates too low they will lose money. This con-tinuous search for accuracy is good for consumers as well as insurance compa-nies. The majority of consumers benefit because they are not subsidizing people who are worse insurance risks\u2014people who are more likely to file claims than they are.\nThe computerization of data has brought more accuracy, speed and effi-\nciency to businesses of all kinds. In the insurance arena, credit information has been used for decades to help underwriters decide whether to accept or reject applications for insurance. New advances in information technology have led to the development of insurance scores, which enable insurers to better assess the risk of future claims.\nAn insurance score is a numerical ranking based on a person\u2019s credit history. \nActuarial studies show that how a person manages his or her financial affairs, which is what an insurance score indicates, is a good predictor of insurance claims. Insurance scores are used to help insurers differentiate between lower and higher insurance risks and thus charge a premium equal to the risk they are assuming. Statistically, people who have a poor insurance score are more likely to file a claim.\nInsurance scores do not include data on race or income because insurers do \nnot collect this information from applicants for insurance.\nThe Poor Economy Has Not Had a Negative Impact on Credit Scores: \nAccording to an April 2009 Property Casualty Insurers of America (PCI) release, the recent economic downturn did not have the negative effect on credit scores that some people predicted. Major consumer credit reporting agencies such as Fair Isaac and TransUnion have reported that average scores remain steady or have improved, possibly because consumers are saving more and paying off debt. Despite the economy and credit crisis, no state has made regulatory changes to insurers\u2019 use of insurance scores, PCI notes.  \nFederal Activities: \n The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked nine of \nthe largest homeowners insurance companies to provide information that it says \nwill allow it to determine how consumer credit data are used by the companies in underwriting and rate setting. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, passed in 2003, directed the FTC to consult with the Office of Fair Housing and ", "46": "40  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceCredit Scoring\nEqual Opportunity on how the use of credit information may affect the avail-\nability and affordability of property/casualty insurance, whether the use of cer-tain factors by credit scoring systems could have a disparate impact on minori-ties and, if so, whether the computer models used could be modified to produce comparable results with less negative impact. The study is expected to be final-ized sometime 2010.\nIn a similar study, the FTC found that auto insurers\u2019 use of insurance credit \nscores leads to more accurate underwriting of auto insurance policies in that there is a correlation between insurance scores and the likelihood of filing an insurance claim. The FTC report, Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance, released in July 2007, also states that credit scores cannot easily be used as a proxy for race and ethnic origin. In other words, credit scoring predicted risk for members of minority groups in much the same way that it predicted risk for members of nonminority groups.\nThe Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 directed the FTC to \naddress the issue of whether the use of credit had a disparate impact on the availability and affordability of insurance for minorities. Based on a poll of con-sumers, the General Accountability Office has recommended that the Treasury and FTC take steps to improve consumers\u2019 understanding of credit scoring and how credit histories are used, targeting in particular those with less education and less experience in obtaining credit.\nThe Federal Reserve also studied the use of credit scoring. Although looking \nat credit scoring to quantify risk posed by a borrower rather than an applicant for insurance or a policyholder, the Federal Reserve said in a report issued at the end of August 2007 that credit scores were predictive of credit risk and were not proxies or substitutes for race ethnicity or gender, underscoring the FTC study.\nInsurance Scores: Insurance scores are confidential rankings based on credit \nhistory information. They are a measure of how a person manages his or her \nfinancial affairs. People who manage their finances well tend to also manage other important aspects of their lives responsibly, such as driving a car. Com-bined with factors such as geographical area, previous crashes, age and gender, insurance scores enable auto insurers to price more accurately, so that people less likely to file a claim pay less for their insurance than people who are more likely to file a claim. For homeowners insurance, insurers use other factors com-bined with credit such as the home\u2019s construction, location and proximity to water supplies for fighting fires.\nInsurance scores predict the average claim behavior of a group of people \nwith essentially the same credit history. A good score is typically above 760 and ", "47": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t41Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nCredit Scoring\na bad score is below 600. People with low insurance scores tend to file more \nclaims. But there are exceptions. Within that group, there may be individuals who have stellar driving records and have never filed a claim just as there are teenager drivers who have never had a crash although teenagers as a group have more accidents than people in other age groups.\nCredit Report Information\u2014Who Wants It?  It is becoming increasingly \nimportant to have an acceptable credit record. Whether we like it or not, society equates the ability to manage credit responsibly with responsible behavior, even if individuals have a bad credit record through no fault of their own. Landlords often look at applicants\u2019 credit records before renting apartments to see whether they manage their finances responsibly and are therefore likely to pay their rent on time. Banks and other lenders look at the credit records of loan applicants to find out whether they are likely to have loans repaid. Some employers also look at credit records, especially where employees handle money, and view a good credit record as a measure of maturity and stability.\nIn some insurance companies, underwriters have long used credit records \nin cases where additional information was needed. Before the development of automated scoring systems, underwriters would look at the data and make deci-sions, often erring on the overly cautious side that disadvantaged many more people. Automated insurance scoring and underwriting systems eliminate the weaknesses inherent in someone\u2019s personal judgment and have allowed more drivers to be placed in preferred and standard rating classifications, saving them money. With the development of these scoring models, the use of credit-related information in underwriting and rating for many insurers has become routine. Insurers use insurance scores to different extents and in different ways. Most use them to screen new applicants for insurance and price new business.\nWhy Insurers Need It:  Insurers need to be able to assess the risk of loss\u2014the \npossibility that a driver or a homeowner will have an accident and file a claim\u2014in order to decide whether to insure that individual and what rate to set for the coverage provided. The more accurate the information, the closer the insurance company can come to making appropriate decisions. Where information is insufficient, applicants for insurance may be placed in the wrong risk classifica-tion. That means that some good drivers will pay more than they should for coverage and some bad drivers will pay less than they should. The insurance company will probably collect enough premiums between the two groups to pay claims and expenses, but the good drivers will be subsidizing the bad.\nBy law in every state, insurers are prohibited from setting rates that unfairly ", "48": "42  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceCredit Scoring\ndiscriminate against any individual.

Insurance scores help insurers accom-plish these objectives.", "49": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t43Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nEarthquakes: Risk and Insurance Issues\nEarthquakes: Risk and Insurance Issues\nAn earthquake is a sudden and rapid shaking of the earth caused by the break-\ning and shifting of rock beneath the earth\u2019s surface. This shaking can sometimes trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires and tsunamis. Unlike other nat-ural disasters such as hurricanes, there are no specific seasons for earthquakes.\nEarthquakes in the United States are not covered under standard homeown-\ners or business insurance policies. Coverage is usually available for earthquake damage in the form of an endorsement to a home or business insurance policy. However, insurers that do not sell earthquake insurance may still be impacted by these catastrophes due to losses from fire following a quake. These losses could involve claims for business interruption and additional living expenses as well. Cars and other vehicles are covered for earthquake damage under the com-prehensive part of the auto insurance policy.\nIn the United States about 5,000 quakes strike each year. Since 1900, earth-\nquakes have occurred in 39 states and caused damage in all 50. One of the worst catastrophes in U.S. history, the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, would have caused insured losses of $96 billion, were the quake to hit under current eco-nomic and demographic conditions, according to AIR Worldwide.\nThe potential cost of earthquakes has been growing because of increasing urban \ndevelopment in seismically active areas and the vulnerability of older buildings, which may not have been built or upgraded to current building codes.\nThe Northridge earthquake, which struck Southern California on January \n17, 1994, was the most costly quake in U.S. history, causing an estimated $20 billion in total property damage, including $12.5 billion in insured losses. In its wake the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) was created in 1996. Fearing insolvency from another massive earthquake, the vast majority of insurers in the state\u2019s homeowners insurance market had severely restricted or ceased writ-ing coverage altogether after Northridge. To ensure the availability of homeown-ers coverage and end a serious threat to the vitality of the state\u2019s housing mar-ket, the California Legislature established the CEA as a publicly managed, largely privately funded entity. \nOnly about 12 percent of Californians now purchase earthquake coverage, \ndown from about 30 percent in 1996 when the devastating 1994 Northridge quake was still fresh in people\u2019s minds. To encourage more Californians to buy the coverage, the CEA, approved an average 22 percent rate cut, which went into effect July 1, 2006. The CEA says that a sharp drop in the cost of reinsur-ance and several years without a major quake, allowing the buildup reserves, made the cut possible.", "50": "44  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceEarthquakes: Risk and Insurance Issues\nLosses from Major Recent Earthquakes: At the beginning of 2010 there were \ntwo major earthquakes: a 7.0 magnitude quake in Haiti in January and a 8.8 \nmagnitude quake in Chile in February.

Others are internal, such as the level of competition.\nFortunately, insurance companies run their businesses conservatively, as \nif every day might bring some new disaster, so despite current economic and financial conditions, the industry has been able to function normally. Unlike banks, insurers are not highly leveraged (they generally do not borrow to make investments or to pay claims); they limit the amount of risk they assume to the capital they have on hand; and because they do not sell the risks they assume to another party\u2014they have some \u201cskin in the game\u201d\u2014they must underwrite care-fully or suffer the consequences.\nThe insurance industry is cyclical. Rates and profits fluctuate depending on \nthe phase of the cycle, particularly in commercial coverages. The profitability cycle may be somewhat different for different types of insurance. \nThe cycle of the early and mid-1980s was among the most severe that the \nindustry has experienced. That cycle centered on liability insurance. The most recent hard market began early in about 2001 and peaked in early 2004. The industry has been experiencing a soft market due to the poor economy. While there had been some indication that rates were flattening out, industry analysts expect to soft market to continue well into 2010.\nThe Insurance Cycle:  The property/casualty insurance industry has exhibited \ncyclical behavior for many years, as far back as the 1920s. These cycles are char-acterized by periods of rising rates leading to increased profitability. Following a period of solid but not spectacular rates of return, the industry enters a down phase where prices soften, supply of insurance becomes plentiful and, eventu-ally, profitability diminishes or vanishes completely. In the cycle\u2019s down phase, as results deteriorate, the basic ability of insurance companies to underwrite new business or, for some companies even to renew some existing policies, can be impaired because the capital needed to support the underwriting of risk has been depleted through losses. Cycles vary in their severity.\nThe insurance industry cycle is not unlike the cycle that occurs in agri-\nculture, for example, in the wheat and beef markets. Demand for the product in both industries is relatively stable and is relatively unresponsive to price changes, while supply can vary from year to year. This means that when supply ", "52": "46  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceFinancial  and Market Conditions\nincreases, lowering the price will not instantly \u201cclear\u201d the market of excess sup-\nply. If the price of auto insurance is cut in half, people will still buy only one policy, although they may increase the amount of coverage they purchase.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s cycles were regular, with a three-year period of soft \npricing followed by a three-year period of hard pricing in practically all lines of property/casualty insurance. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were only two cycles, one mainly affecting auto insurance in the mid-1970s and the other in the mid-1980s, affecting commercial liability insurance. The commercial liabil-ity insurance cycle gave rise to the \u201cliability crisis,\u201d when certain types of com-mercial liability coverages, such as insurance for daycare centers, municipalities, ski resorts and any establishment selling liquor, became difficult to obtain. Since that time, with the exception of the difficulty in obtaining medical malpractice insurance in the early part of the last decade, the insurance cycle has had less of an impact on the public.", "53": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t47Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nFlood Insurance\nFlood Insurance\nBecause of frequent flooding of the Mississippi River during the 1960s and the \nrising cost of taxpayer funded disaster relief for flood victims, in 1968 Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It has three mandates: to provide residential and commercial insurance coverage for flood damage, to improve floodplain management and to develop maps of flood hazard zones.\nWhile the comprehensive section of an auto insurance policy covers flood \ndamage to vehicles, there is no coverage for flooding in standard homeowners, renters or commercial property insurance policies. It is available in a separate policy from the NFIP and from a few private insurers. Despite efforts to publi-cize this, many people exposed to the risk of floods still fail to purchase flood insurance.\nIt was the widespread flooding associated with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 \nthat drew attention to the NFIP and set in motion debate about how to improve it. So far, Congress has not taken steps to significantly revamp the program.\nFederal flood insurance is only available where local governments have \nadopted adequate flood plain management regulations for their floodplain areas as set out by NFIP. About 20,400 communities across the country participate in the program. NFIP coverage is also available outside of the high-hazard areas.\nThe NFIP law was amended in 1969 to provide coverage for mudslides and \nagain in 1973. Until then, the purchase of flood insurance had been voluntary, with only about one million policies in force. The 1973 amendment put con-straints on the use of federal funds in high-risk floodplains, a measure that was expected to lead to almost universal flood coverage in these zones. The law pro-hibits lenders that are federally regulated, supervised or insured by federal agen-cies from lending money on a property in a floodplain zone when a community is participating in the NFIP, unless the property is covered by flood insurance.\nLegislation was enacted in 1994 to tighten enforcement of flood insurance \nrequirements. Regulators can now fine banks with a pattern of failure to enforce the law and lenders can purchase flood insurance on behalf of homeowners who fail to buy it themselves, then bill them for coverage. The law includes a provision that denies federal disaster aid to people who have been flooded twice and have failed to purchase insurance after the first flood.\nBuildings constructed in a floodplain after a community has met regula-\ntions must conform to elevation requirements. When repair, reconstruction or improvement to an older building equals or exceeds 50 percent of its market value, the structure must be updated to conform to current building codes. A 2007 NFIP study on the benefits of elevating buildings showed that due to ", "54": "48  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceFlood Insurance\nsignificantly lower premiums homeowners can usually recover the higher con-\nstruction costs in less than five years for homes built in a \u201cvelocity\u201d zone, where the structure is likely to be subject to wave damage, and in five to 15 years in a standard flood zone. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) esti-mates that buildings constructed to NFIP standards suffer about 80 percent less damage annually that those not built in compliance.\nHow It Works:\n  The NFIP is administered by FEMA, now part of the Depart-\nment of Homeland Security. Flood insurance was initially only available \nthrough insurance agents who dealt directly with the federal program. The \u201cdirect\u201d policy program has been supplemented since 1983 with a private/public cooperative arrangement, known as \u201cWrite Your Own,\u201d through which a pool of insurance companies issue policies and adjust flood claims on behalf of the federal government under their own names, charging the same premium as the direct program. Participating insurers receive an expense allowance for policies written and claims processed. The federal government retains responsibility for underwriting losses. Today, most policies are issued through the Write-Your-Own program but some nonfederally backed coverage is available from the pri-vate market.\nThe NFIP is expected to be self-supporting (i.e., premiums are set at an \nactuarially sound level) in an average loss year, as reflected in past experience. In an extraordinary year, as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, losses can greatly exceed premiums, leaving the NFIP with a huge debt to the U.S. Treasury that it is unlikely to be able to pay back. Hurricane Katrina losses and the percentage of flood damage that was uninsured led to calls for a revamping of the entire flood program.\nAs with other types of insurance, rates for flood insurance are based on the \ndegree of risk. FEMA assesses flood risk for all the participating communities, resulting in the publication of thousands of individual flood rate maps. High-risk areas are known as Special Flood Hazard Areas, or SFHAs.\nFlood plain maps are redrawn periodically, removing some properties previ-\nously designated as high hazard and adding new ones. New technology enables flood mitigation programs to more accurately pinpoint areas vulnerable to flooding. As development in and around flood plains increases, run off patterns can change, causing flooding in areas that were formerly not considered high risk and vice versa.\nPeople tend to underestimate the risk of flooding. The highest-risk areas \n(Zone A) have an annual flood risk of 1 percent and a 26 percent chance of flooding over the lifetime of a 30-year mortgage, compared with a 9 percent risk ", "55": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t49Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nFlood Insurance\nof fire over the same period. In addition, people who live in areas adjacent to \nhigh-risk zones may still be exposed to floods on occasion. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in this country involve flooding, the NFIP says. Since the incep-tion of the federal program, some 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses were for damage in areas not officially designated at the time of loss as special flood haz-ard areas. NFIP coverage is available outside high-risk zones at a lower premium.\nTo prevent people putting off the purchase of coverage until waters are \nrising and flooding is inevitable, policyholders must wait 30 days before their policy takes effect. In 1993, 7,800 policies purchased at the last minute resulted in $48 million in claims against only $625,000 in premiums.\nProposals for Change: \n The NFIP has four major goals: to decrease the risk of \nflood losses; reduce the costs and consequences of flooding; reduce the demand \nfor federal assistance; and preserve and restore beneficial floodplain functions. In a final report published in 2006 by the American Institutes for Research (AIR), which conducted an evaluation of the federal flood insurance program, AIR said that although much had been accomplished, the program fell short of meeting its goals in part because the NFIP did not have the ability to guide development away from floodplains and cannot restore beneficial floodplain functions once they have been impaired. In addition, AIR said, many people still are not covered or not adequately covered for flood damage. AIR also noted that the NFIP was hampered in reaching its goals by insufficient Congressional funding, lack of pertinent data, misperceptions about the nature of the program and the breakdown in coordination among its three major sectors.\nA report published by FEMA in 2007 suggests that development patterns \nshould be changed to protect environmentally sensitive areas and that commu-nities in the flood program should be encouraged or required to ban develop-ment in these locations.\nAnother criticism of the NFIP is that it does not charge enough for cover-\nage. Among the reasons for the premium shortfall is that the cost of coverage on dwellings that were built before floodplain management regulations were established in their communities is subsidized. As a result, the premiums paid for flood coverage by the owners of these properties reflect only 30 to 40 per-cent of the true risk of loss. In January 2006 FEMA estimated an annual shortfall in premium income of $750 million due to these subsidies. Some subsidized properties also suffer repetitive losses. Repetitive loss properties accounted for about $4.6 billion in claims payments between 1978 and 2004. The AIR report acknowledged that the current system is not eliminating existing damage-prone buildings as quickly as expected.", "56": "50  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceInsurance Fraud\nInsurance Fraud\nThe Insurance Information Institute estimates that fraud accounts for 10 percent \nof the property/casualty insurance industry\u2019s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses, or about $30 billion a year. This fraud results in higher premiums.\nFraud may be committed at different points in the insurance transaction by \ndifferent parties: applicants for insurance, policyholders, third-party claimants and professionals who provide services to claimants. Common frauds include \u201cpadding,\u201d or inflating actual claims; misrepresenting facts on an insurance application; submitting claims for injuries or damage that never occurred; and \u201cstaging\u201d accidents.\nPrompted by the incidence of insurance fraud, 41 states and the District of \nColumbia have set up fraud bureaus (some bureaus have limited powers, and some states have more than one bureau to address fraud in different lines of insurance). These agencies have reported increases in referrals (tips about sus-pected fraud), cases opened, convictions and court-ordered restitution.\nInsurance fraud can be \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft.\u201d Hard fraud occurs when someone \ndeliberately fabricates claims or fakes an accident. Soft insurance fraud, also known as opportunistic fraud, occurs when people pad legitimate claims, for example, or, in the case of business owners, list fewer employees or misrepresent the work they do to pay lower workers compensation premiums.\nPeople who commit insurance fraud range from organized criminals, who \nsteal large sums through fraudulent business activities and insurance claim mills, to professionals and technicians, who inflate the cost of services or charge for services not rendered, to ordinary people who want to cover their deductible or view filing a claim as an opportunity to make a little money.\nSome lines of insurance are more vulnerable to fraud than others. \nHealthcare, workers compensation and auto insurance are believed to be the sectors most affected.\nInsurance fraud received little attention until the 1980s when the rising \nprice of insurance and the growth in organized fraud spurred efforts to pass stronger antifraud laws. Allied with insurers were parties affected by fraud\u2014consumers who pay higher insurance premiums to compensate for losses from fraud; direct victims of organized fraud groups; and chiropractors and other medical professionals who are concerned that their reputations will be tar-nished.\nOne out of five Americans think it is acceptable to defraud insurance com-\npanies under certain conditions, according to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. The organization released the findings in a 2008 study, \u201cThe Four Faces ", "57": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t51Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nInsurance Fraud\nof Insurance Fraud.\u201d It found that the public is consistently more tolerant of \nspecific insurance frauds today than it was 10 years before.\nIn addition, studies by the Insurance Research Council show that significant \nnumbers of Americans think it is all right to inflate their insurance claims to make up for insurance premiums they have paid in previous years when they have had no claims or to pad a claim to make up for the deductible they would have to pay.\nInsurers must preserve the fine line between investigating suspicious claims \nand harassing legitimate claimants and the need to comply with the time requirements for paying claims imposed by fair claim practice regulations. All states have unfair claim settlement practice laws on their books to ensure that the parties involved are informed of the progress of investigations and that investigators settle the claim promptly or within a specified amount of time. About 19 states have provisions that provide guidance and protection for inves-tigators by allowing time limit extensions or waivers and detailing what evi-dence is required and to whom the evidence should be made available.\nInsurers\u2019 Antifraud Measures: \n The legal options of an insurance company \nthat suspects fraud are limited. The insurer can only inform law enforcement \nagencies of suspicious claims, withhold payment and collect evidence for use in a court. The success of the battle against insurance fraud therefore depends on two elements: the level of priority assigned by legislators, regulators, law enforcement agencies and society as a whole to the problem and the resources devoted by the insurance industry itself. To that end most insurers have estab-lished special investigation units (SIUs). These entities help identify and investi-gate suspicious claims.\nInsurers have also created a national fraud academy. A joint initiative of the \nProperty Casualty Insurers Association of America, the FBI, National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) and the International Association of Special Investigating Units, it is designed to fight insurance claims fraud by educating and training fraud investigators. It offers online classes under the leadership of the NICB.", "58": "52  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceThe Liability System and Medical Malpractice \nThe Liability System and  \nMedical Malpractice Insurance Issues \nLitigiousness has become a societal problem in the United States. The tort sys-\ntem cost $254.7 billion in 2008 in direct costs, which translates into $838 per person, and many billions of dollars more in indirect costs, according to Towers Perrin\u2019s most recent tort costs study. U.S. consumers pay directly for the high cost of going to court through higher liability insurance premiums because lia-bility insurance rates reflect what insurance companies pay out for their policy-holders\u2019 legal defense and any judgments against them. And they pay indirectly in higher prices for goods and services since businesses pass on to consumers the expenses they incur in protecting themselves against lawsuits, including the cost of commercial liability insurance.\nBeginning in the 1980s, in an effort to reduce litigation costs, business \ngroups and others mounted a campaign to reform tort law. Tort law is the basis for the U.S. liability system. Most reforms have taken place on the state level and during the last decade all but a handful of states passed significant tort law reforms. However, some have been overturned by the courts.\nMany reform efforts have focused on medical malpractice issues. Medical \nmalpractice insurance covers doctors and other professionals in the medical field for liability claims arising from their treatment of patients. \nThe cost of medical malpractice insurance began to rise in the early 2000s \nafter a period of essentially flat prices. Rate increases were precipitated in part by the growing size of claims, particularly in urban areas. Among the other factors driving up prices was a reduced supply of available coverage as several major insurers exited the medical malpractice business because of the difficulty of making a profit. \nNew research suggests that premium increases may be moderating but, for \nany significant turnaround to take root, major reforms in the delivery of medi-cal care that focus on patient safety need to occur, industry observers say.\nState Tort Reform Issues\nCaps in Noneconomic Damages: According to the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, 30 states, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico limit jury awards \nin malpractice cases. In the past few years, a number court have ruled against such limits. In Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled that a 2005 state law that lim-ited jury awards for pain and suffering in malpractice cases to $350,000 improp-erly interfered with a jury\u2019s duty to determine damages in a civil lawsuit. In the decision Chief Justice Carol Hunstein said that limits in any amount violate the ", "59": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I. \tInsurance \tHandbook \t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t53\nAuto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nThe Liability System and Medical Malpractice\nright to trial by jury. In Illinois, the Supreme Court overturned the state\u2019s 2005 \nmedical malpractice statute, which capped noneconomic (pain and suffering) \nmedical malpractice awards at $500,000 in lawsuits against physicians and $1 \nmillion for hospitals. The court ruled that the law violated the state\u2019s constitu -\ntional principle of separation of powers in that lawmakers had made decisions that should be made by judges and juries.\nSome states, such as Maryland, are deciding to retain their caps when chal -\nlenged. \nArbitration:\n  To keep small disputes out of the courts, insurers are increasingly \nturning to arbitration. The nation\u2019s largest arbitration provider, nonprofit Arbi -\ntration Forums, resolved more than 520,000 inter-insurance disputes in 2009 \nvalued at $2.5 billion, for a savings in litigation costs of $700 million. Disputes \nleading to arbitration typically arise when insurance or self-insured companies \nbelieve their policyholders or employees are not at fault or due to disagreement \nover the percentage of liability or the amount of damages. More than 85 percent \nof these disputes involve auto collisions.\nTort Liability Environment:  In December 2009 the American Tort Reform \nAssociation (ATRA) released its annual list of states and counties characterized \nas \u201cJudicial Hellholes,\u201d places with courts that have a disproportionately harm -\nful impact on civil litigation. ATRA explains that personal injury lawyers seek \nout these places as targets for their efforts to expand liability and develop new \nopportunities for litigation. ATRA\u2019s newest list includes six Judicial Hellholes, \nincluding holdovers South Florida; West Virginia; Cook County, Illinois; and \nAtlantic County, New Jersey, and New Mexico appellate courts and New York \nCity, which are new on the list. ATRA highlights several reforms that can help \nrestore balance to these jurisdictions. They include stopping venue shopping \n(looking for jurisdictions where juries are favorable to plaintiffs), imposing sanctions for bringing frivolous lawsuits, stemming abuse of consumer laws, \nensuring that noneconomic damage awards serve a compensatory purpose, and \nstrengthening rules to promote sound science in the courtroom.

Microinsurance products tend to be much less costly than traditional products and thus extend protection to a much wider market. The approach is an out-growth of the microfinancing projects developed by Bangladeshi Nobel Prize-winning banker and economist Muhammad Yunus, which helped millions of low-income individuals in Asia and Africa to set up businesses and buy houses. American International Group Inc. (AIG) was one of the first companies to offer microinsurance and began selling policies in Uganda in 1997. Swiss Re, Munich Re, Allianz and Zurich Financial Services have also entered the microinsurance arena. Disasters such as the 2005 tsunami in Indonesia and the 2010 Haiti earth-quake have demonstrated the need for insurance in many regions, prompting insurers to develop new products. While the coverage is often geared to protec-tion from natural disasters, there are also programs covering life/health risks as well.\nWith limited growth prospects in the insurance markets of developed \ncountries, which are largely saturated, insurers see microinsurance in emerging economies as presenting significant potential for growth and profitability. A 2009 Swiss Re report on world insurance markets found that premium growth in emerging markets far outpaced growth in industrialized countries in 2008. The study identified the following regions as \u201cemerging markets\u201d: Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, the Middle East (excluding Israel) and Central Asia, Turkey and Africa.\n In 2009 the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the World \nBank, the International Labor Organization and other multilateral groups launched a program to improve access to insurance in emerging and under-served markets called the \u201cAccess to Insurance Initiative.\u201d Also in 2009 rep-resentatives from over 60 countries participated in the Fifth International Microinsurance Conference, which was organized by the reinsurer Munich Re and the Microinsurance Network, a joint effort of aid organizations, multilateral agencies, insurers, policymakers and academics.", "61": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t55Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nNo-Fault Auto Insurance and Other Auto Liability Systems\nNo-Fault Auto Insurance and Other Auto \nLiability Systems\nState auto liability insurance laws fall into four broad categories: no-fault, choice \nno-fault, tort liability and add-on. The major differences are whether there are restrictions on the right to sue and whether the policyholder\u2019s own insurer pays first-party benefits, up to the state maximum amount, regardless of who is at fault in the accident. These alternative systems have evolved over time as con-sumers, regulators and insurers have sought ways to lower the cost and speed up the delivery of compensation for auto accidents. \nThe term \u201cno-fault\u201d auto insurance is often used loosely to denote any auto \ninsurance program that allows policyholders to recover financial losses from their own insurance company, regardless of fault. But in its strictest form no-fault applies only to state laws that both provide for the payment of no-fault first-party benefits and restrict the right to sue, the so-called \u201climited tort\u201d option. The first-party (policyholder) benefit coverage is known as personal injury protection (PIP). \nUnder current no-fault laws, motorists may sue for severe injuries and for \npain and suffering only if the case meets certain conditions. These conditions, known as a threshold, relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms (a descriptive or verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills, a monetary threshold. Some laws also include minimum requirements for the days of disability incurred as a result of the accident. Because high threshold no-fault systems restrict litigation, they tend to reduce costs and delays in pay-ing claims. Verbal thresholds eliminate the incentive to inflate claims that may exist when there is a dollar \u201ctarget\u201d for medical expenses. However, in some states the verbal threshold has been eroded over time by broad judicial interpre-tation of the verbal threshold language, and PIP coverage has become the target of abuse and fraud by dishonest doctors and clinics that bill for unnecessary and expensive medical procedures, pushing up costs.\nCurrently 12 states and Puerto Rico have no-fault auto insurance laws. \nFlorida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have verbal thresholds.

In New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, motor-ists may reject the lawsuit threshold and retain the right to sue for any auto-related injury.

Each insurance company compensates \nits own policyholders (the first party) for the cost of minor injuries, regardless of who was at fault in the accident. (The second party is the insurance company and the third is the other party or parties hurt as a result of the accident.)\nThese first-party benefits, known as personal injury protection (PIP), are \na mandatory coverage in true no-fault states. The extent of coverage varies by state. In states with the most comprehensive benefits, a policyholder receives compensation for medical fees, lost wages, funeral costs and other out-of-pocket expenses. The major variations involve dollar limits on medical and hospital expenses, funeral and burial expenses, lost income and the amount to be paid a person hired to perform essential services that an injured non-income producer is unable to perform.\nDrivers in no-fault states may sue for severe injuries if the case meets certain \nconditions. These conditions are known as the tort liability threshold and may be expressed in verbal terms such as death or significant disfigurement (verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (monetary threshold).\nChoice no-fault:  In choice no-fault states, drivers may select one of two \noptions: a no-fault auto insurance policy or a traditional tort liability policy. In \nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania the no-fault option has a verbal threshold. In Ken-tucky there is a monetary threshold.\nTort liability: \n In traditional tort liability states, there are no restrictions on \nlawsuits. A policyholder at fault in a car crash can be sued by the other driver \nand by the other driver\u2019s passengers for the pain and suffering the accident caused as well as for out-of-pocket expenses such as medical costs.\nAdd-on: \n In add-on states, drivers receive compensation from their own insur-\nance company as they do in no-fault states, but there are no restrictions on \nlawsuits. The term \u201cadd-on\u201d is used because in these states first-party benefits have been added on to the traditional tort liability system. In add-on states, first-party coverage may not be mandatory and the benefits may be lower than in true no-fault states.", "63": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t57Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nRegulation\nRegulation\nInsurance is regulated by the individual states. The move to modernize insur-\nance regulation is being driven in part by the globalization of insurance services. Some large U.S. companies that operate in other countries support the concept of a federal system that provides one-stop regulatory approval while others believe the merits of a state system outweigh the virtues of a single national regulator. As a result of discussions about the merits of each system, states are making it easier for insurers to respond quickly to market forces. States monitor insurance company solvency. One important function related to this is oversee-ing rate changes. Rate making is the process of calculating a price to cover the future cost of insurance claims and expenses, including a margin for profit. To establish rates, insurers look at past trends and changes in the current environ-ment that may affect potential losses in the future. Rates are not the same as premiums. A rate is the price of a given unit of insurance\u2014$2.50 per $1,000 of earthquake coverage, for example. The premium represents the total cost of many units. If the price to rebuild a house is $150,000, the premium would be 150 x $2.50. Rates vary according to the likelihood and potential size of loss. Using the example of earthquake insurance, rates would be higher near a fault line and for a brick house, which is more susceptible to damage, than a frame one.\nWhile the regulatory processes in each state vary, three principles guide \nevery state\u2019s rate regulation system: that rates be adequate (to maintain insur-ance company solvency), but not excessive (not so high as to lead to exorbitant profits), nor unfairly discriminatory (price differences must reflect expected claim and expense differences). Recently, in auto and home insurance, the  twin issues of availability and affordability, which are not explicitly included in the guiding principles, have been assuming greater importance in regulatory decisions.\nIn line with these principles, states have adopted various methods of regu-\nlating insurance rates, which fall roughly into two categories: \u201cprior approval\u201d and \u201ccompetitive.\u201d This does not mean there is no competition in states using a prior approval system. Most approved rates in prior approval states are the rates used, but in some cases, particularly in commercial coverages, companies com-pete at rates below these approved ceilings.\nRegulation Modernization\nIncreasingly, even in the most regulated states, officials are relying on competi-tion among insurance companies to keep rates down and are modernizing and ", "64": "58  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceRegulation\nstreamlining the rate setting process.\nThe move to modernize insurance regulation is being driven in part by the \nglobalization of insurance services. Some large U.S. companies that operate in \nother countries support the concept of a federal system that provides one-stop regulatory approval while others believe the merits of a state system outweigh the virtues of a single national regulator. As a result of discussions about the merits of each system, states are making it easier for insurers to respond quickly to market forces. Since 2009, various pieces of legislation have been introduced in Congress that respond to a number of concerns: lack of an entity at the fed-eral level that can represent insurance interests, particularly in the discussion of international issues; the need for better oversight of systemic risk\u2014the inter-connectedness of the risk assumed by a few large financial services companies whose failure could bring down the entire financial system; and the need to streamline the regulation of reinsurers and surplus lines insurers.\nFor example, in Georgia, a law was signed in May 2008 that allows auto \ninsurance companies to adjust most rates without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner. Georgia joins at least 30 other states that let rates more closely reflect competition in the marketplace\nType of State Rating Laws\nPrior Approval:\n  The insurer must file rates, rules, etc. with state regulators. \nDepending on the statute, the filing becomes effective when a specified waiting \nperiod elapses (if the state regulator does not take specific action on the filing, it is deemed approved automatically) or the state regulator formally approves the filing.

It is a way of transferring \nor \u201cceding\u201d some of the financial risk insurance companies assume in insur-ing cars, homes and businesses to another insurance company, the reinsurer. Reinsurance, a highly complex global business, accounted for about 9 percent of the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry premiums in 2008, according to the Reinsurance Association of America.\nThe reinsurance business is evolving. Traditionally, reinsurance transactions \nwere between two insurance entities: the primary insurer that sold the original insurance policies and the reinsurer. Most still are. Primary insurers and reinsur-ers can share both the premiums and losses or reinsurers may assume the pri-mary company\u2019s losses above a certain dollar limit in return for a fee. However, risks of various kinds, particularly of natural disasters, are now being sold by insurers and reinsurers to institutional investors in the form of catastrophe bonds and other alternative risk-spreading mechanisms. Increasingly, new prod-ucts reflect a gradual blending of reinsurance and investment banking.\nAfter Hurricane Andrew hit Southern Florida in 1992, causing $15.5 billion \nin insured losses at the time, it became clear that U.S. insurers had seriously underestimated the extent of their liability for property losses in a megadisas-ter. Until Hurricane Andrew, the industry had thought $8 billion was the larg-est possible catastrophe loss. Reinsurers subsequently reassessed their position, which in turn caused primary companies to reconsider their catastrophe reinsur-ance needs.\nThe shortage and high cost of traditional catastrophe reinsurance precipi-\ntated by Hurricane Andrew and declining interest rates, which sent investors looking for higher yields, prompted interest in securitization of insurance risk. Among the precursors to catastrophe bonds and other forms of securitiza-tion were contingency financing bonds such as those issued for the Florida Windstorm Association in 1996, which provided cash in the event of a catastro-phe but had to be repaid after a loss, and contingent surplus notes\u2014an agree-ment with a bank or other lender that in the event of a megadisaster that would significantly reduce policyholders\u2019 surplus, funds would be made available at a predetermined price. Funds to pay for the transaction should money be needed, are held in U.S. Treasuries. Surplus notes are not considered debt, therefore do not hamper an insurer\u2019s ability to write additional insurance. In addition, there were equity puts, through which an insurer would receive a sum of money in the event of a catastrophic loss in exchange for stock or other options.\nA catastrophe bond is a specialized security, introduced in 1997, that ", "67": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t61Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nReinsurance\nincreases insurers\u2019 ability to provide insurance protection by transferring the \nrisk to bond investors. Commercial banks and other lenders have been securitiz-ing mortgages for years, freeing up capital to expand their mortgage business. Insurers and reinsurers issue catastrophe bonds to the securities market through an issuer known as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle (SPRV) set up specifi-cally for this purpose. These bonds have complicated structures and are typically created offshore where tax and regulatory treatment may be more favorable. SPRVs collect the premium from the insurance or reinsurance company and the principal from investors and hold them in a trust in the form of U.S. Treasuries or other highly rated assets, using the investment income to pay interest on the principal. Catastrophe bonds pay high interest rates but if the trigger event occurs, investors lose the interest and sometimes the principal, depending on the structure of the bond, both of which may be used to cover the insurer\u2019s disaster losses. Bonds may be issued for a one-year term or multiple years, often three.\nThe field has gradually evolved to the point where some investors and \ninsurance company issuers are beginning to feel comfortable with the concept, with some coming back to the capital markets each year. In addition to the high interest rates catastrophe bonds pay, their attraction to investors is that they diversify investment portfolio risk, thus reducing the volatility of returns. The returns on most other securities are tied to economic activity rather than natu-ral disasters. Catastrophe bonds have evolved into a multibillion dollar industry. Though pioneered by reinsurers, primary insurers now frequently sponsor new issues.\nIn addition to catastrophe bonds, catastrophe options were developed but \nthe market for these options never took off. Another alternative is the exchange of risk where individual companies in different parts of the world swap a certain amount of losses. Payment is triggered by the occurrence of an agreed upon event at a certain level of magnitude.", "68": "62  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceResidual Markets\nResidual Markets\nIn a normal competitive market, insurers are free to select from among people \napplying for insurance those drivers, property owners and commercial opera-tions they wish to insure. They do this by evaluating the risks involved through a process called underwriting.\nApplicants who are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d may have difficulty obtaining \ninsurance through the regular \u201cvoluntary\u201d market channels. (The term \u201chigh risk\u201d applies to individuals or individual businesses with a poor loss record due to inadequate safety measures; certain kinds of businesses or professions where the nature of the work is hazardous or where the risk of lawsuits is high; and specific locations where the risk of theft, vandalism or severe storm damage is substantial.) To make basic coverage more readily available to everyone who wants or needs insurance, special insurance plans have been set up by state regulators working with the insurance industry.\nThe business that insurers do not voluntarily assume is called the residual \nmarket. Residual markets may also be called \u201cshared,\u201d because the profits and losses of each type of residual market are shared by all insurers in the state sell-ing that type of insurance, or involuntary, because insurers do not choose to underwrite the business, in contrast to the regular voluntary market.\nResidual market programs are rarely self-sufficient. Where the rates charged \nto high-risk policyholders are too low to support the program\u2019s operation, insur-ers are generally assessed to make up the difference. These additional costs are typically passed on to all insurance consumers. However, in a few states, insur-ers are not able to recoup their residual market losses and political pressure pre-vents rates from rising to the level they should be actuarially.\nThe number of drivers and properties insured in the residual market fluctu-\nates as lawmakers and regulators change laws or address availability, rate ade-quacy and other factors that influence underwriting decisions.\nThe Automobile Residual Market\nThe first of the residual market mechanisms for automobile coverage was estab-lished in New Hampshire in 1938. As states began to pass laws requiring drivers to furnish proof of insurance, having auto liability insurance became a prereq-uisite for driving a car. Today, all 50 states and the District of Columbia use one of four systems to guarantee that auto insurance is available to those who need it. All four systems are commonly known as assigned risk plans, although the term technically applies only to the first type of plan, where each insurer is required to assume its share of residual market policyholders or \u201crisks.\u201d (The ", "69": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t63Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nResidual Markets\nterm \u201crisk\u201d is used in the insurance industry to denote the policyholder or prop-\nerty insured as well as the chance of loss.) Commercial auto insurance is also available through the residual market.\nAutomobile Insurance Plans:\n  The assigned risk plan, the most common \ntype, currently found in 42 states and the District of Columbia, generally is \nadministered through an office created or supported by the state and governed by a board representing insurance companies licensed in the state. Massachu-setts began a three-year process of changing over to an assigned risk plan, begin-ning in April 2008. It formerly had a reinsurance pooling facility.\nWhen agents or company representatives are unable to obtain auto insur-\nance for an applicant in the voluntary market, they submit the application to the assigned risk plan office. These applications are distributed randomly by the automobile insurance plan to all insurance companies that offer automobile liability coverage in the state in proportion to the amount of their voluntary business. Thus, if on a given day the plan receives 100 applications from agents around the state, a company with 10 percent of that state\u2019s regular private pas-senger automobile insurance business will be assigned 10 of those applicants and will be responsible for all associated losses.\nAssigned risk policies usually are more restricted in the coverage they can \nprovide and have lower limits than voluntary market policies. In addition, pre-miums for assigned risk policies usually are significantly higher, although not always sufficiently high enough to cover the increased costs of insuring high-risk drivers.\nJoint Underwriting Associations (JUAs):\n  Automobile JUAs, found in \nfour states, Florida, Hawaii, Michigan and Missouri, are state-mandated pool-\ning mechanisms through which all companies doing business in the state share the premiums of business outside the voluntary market as well as the profits or losses and expenses incurred. To simplify the policyholder distribution pro-cess, insurance agents and company representatives are generally assigned one of several servicing carriers (companies that have agreed for a fee to issue and service JUA policies). They submit applications to that company, which then issues the JUA policy. In Michigan, however, agents submit applications directly to the JUA office, which then distributes them to the servicing carriers. Cover-ages offered by JUAs generally are the same as those offered in the voluntary market but the limits may be lower. Although rates may be higher than in the voluntary market, they may not be sufficient for the JUA to be self-sustaining. State statutes setting up the JUA generally permit it to recoup losses by surcharg-", "70": "64  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceResidual Markets\ning policyholders or deducting losses from state premium taxes. (JUAs may be \nset up for other lines of insurance, including homeowners insurance. JUAs for commercial insurance coverage, such as medical malpractice and liquor liability, may operate somewhat differently in some states, see below.)\nReinsurance Facilities:  Reinsurance facilities exist in North Carolina, New \nHampshire and Massachusetts. (In Massachusetts, beginning in April 2008, the \nreinsurance facility which is known as Commonwealth Automobile Insurers, or CAR, began disbanding over a three-year period as the new \u201dmanaged competi-tion\u201d regulations take effect.) An automobile reinsurance facility is an unincor-porated, nonprofit entity, through which auto insurers provide coverage and service claims. After issuing a policy, an insurer decides whether to handle the policy as part of its regular \u201cvoluntary business\u201d or transfer it to the reinsurance facility or pool. An insurer is permitted to transfer or \u201ccede\u201d to the pool a per-centage of its policies. Premiums for this portion of business are sent to the pool and companies bill the pool for claims payments and expenses. Profits or losses are shared by all auto insurers licensed in the state.\nState Fund: \n One state, Maryland, has a residual market mechanism for auto \ninsurance which is administered by the state.  It was created in 1973. Private \ninsurers do not participate directly in the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) but are required by law to subsidize any losses from the operation, with the cost being charged back against their own policyholders. In years that the fund has a loss, all Maryland insured drivers, including MAIF drivers, help offset the deficit through an assessment mechanism.\nSize of the Auto Insurance Market: \n Together, residual market programs \ninsured about 1.97 million cars in 2007, about 1.06 percent of the total mar-\nket and a 9.0 percent drop from 2006, according to the Automobile Insurance Plans Service Office, which tracks such data. In 1990 the residual market served 6.3 percent of the total market. In 2007, in a major change from much of the 1990s, only one state, North Carolina, had more than a million cars insured through the residual market. At 1.5 million, the pool insured more than 21.6 percent of the state\u2019s total insured vehicles. In South Carolina, which enacted sweeping reforms in 1998, the residual market dropped from 38 percent of all insured cars in 1996 to close to zero in 2007.\nThe Property Residual Market\nPools: \n FAIR Plans, Beach and Windstorm Plans, Assigned Risk and Others: A \npool is an organization of insurers or reinsurers through which particular types ", "71": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t65Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nResidual Markets\nof insurance coverage are provided. The pool acts as a single insuring entity, \nas opposed to some JUAs and assigned risk plans where the policyholder deals directly with an individual insurance company. Premiums, losses and expenses are shared among pool members in agreed-upon amounts. The range of activi-ties handled by the pool varies. Some pool operations are limited to redistrib-uting premiums and losses, while others have broader functions similar to an insurance company. Some pools use specific insurers as servicing carriers.\nIn pools composed of primary companies (as opposed to reinsurers), busi-\nness is placed directly with the pool by the agent. (In a reinsurance pool, a member company underwrites the risk, issues the policy and reinsures the business in the pool, see below.) Pools may be mandated by state legislation or established on a voluntary basis.\nPools assure that insurance is available to property owners in high-risk, gen-\nerally urban or coastal areas, and businesses with a poor safety record or other high risk characteristics. Among the best-known primary pooling arrangements are property insurance plans, such as Beach and Windstorm Plans, which insure owners of properties vulnerable to severe storm damage.\nFAIR Plans: \n Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia currently have \nproperty insurance plans known as FAIR, an acronym for Fair Access to Insur-\nance Requirements Plans. The concept of FAIR Plans was established following passage by Congress of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, a measure designed to address the conditions that led to the 1967 urban riots. This legislation made federal riot reinsurance available to those states that insti-tuted such property insurance pools. One of the plans, Arkansas\u2019 Rural Risk Plan, was created in 1988 to provide a market for property insurance in rural areas where fire protection is poor or nonexistent. Mississippi\u2019s Rural Plan, which offered fire, extended coverage and vandalism, see below, was expanded to cover the entire state in 2003. (The state\u2019s windstorm pool offers wind and hail coverage in coastal counties to the Plan\u2019s policyholders.) Georgia\u2019s FAIR Plan also provides windstorm and hail coverage in coastal counties as do Plans in Massachusetts and New York. In most states where FAIR Plans are in opera-tion, they are mandatory.\nBeach and Windstorm Insurance Plans: \n Counterparts to the FAIR Plans are \nBeach and Windstorm Insurance Plans, operated by property insurers in states \nalong the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts to assure that insurance is available for both residences and commercial properties against damage from hurricanes and other windstorms. Established between 1969 and 1971, Beach and Windstorm Plans ", "72": "66  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceResidual Markets\noperate in a manner similar to FAIR Plans, except that properties must be locat-\ned in a designated area to be eligible for insurance under the Plans.\nThere are currently five Beach and Windstorm Plans: Alabama, Mississippi, \nSouth Carolina, North Carolina and Texas. In 2001 there were seven pools, but Florida\u2019s windstorm pool merged with the joint underwriting association in 2002 to create a new type of residual market entity, see below. In a similar move in 2003, Louisiana merged its FAIR Plan with its coastal pool. The Plans are mandatory in all of these states with the exception of Alabama. (In addition, hail and windstorm coverage for homes in coastal counties is available through some FAIR Plans, see above and the WindMap in New Jersey.) Windstorm Plans in Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas offer only wind and hail coverage. Plans in Alabama and North Carolina offer coverage for fire as well. In some states, Plan policyholders must buy flood insurance also.\nProperty owners who live in areas covered by Beach and Windstorm Plans \nmay be insured for windstorm losses by the Plan or by an individual insur-ance company. If an insurer has accepted all the windstorm risk it is prepared to assume, an applicant for homeowners insurance may purchase a policy that excludes windstorm coverage from the homeowners insurance company and pay a separate premium for windstorm coverage to the Plan.\nOne disadvantage of Beach and Windstorm Plans, and the National Flood \nInsurance Program, is that the availability of insurance encourages development of coastal areas where construction otherwise would not be feasible and where tax money must be spent to protect against continuous erosion to preserve the property.\nIn the past there was a clear delineation between coastal and urban plans \nwith coastal properties insured under Beach and Windstorm Plans, and urban properties under FAIR Plans. Increasingly, the distinctions are blurring. FAIR Plans are acting as an insurer of last resort for residents who live in shoreline communities in states that do not have a Beach and Windstorm Plan, such as New York State. Beach and Windstorm Plans in some states are being merged with FAIR Plans or joint underwriting associations, as in Florida and Louisiana, or are administering new FAIR Plans, as in Texas. As a result, it is difficult to compare the number of properties insured under any Plan with numbers from earlier years. FAIR Plans have almost doubled in size, pushed up in large part by these mergers and the increase in coastal properties in such states as New York and Massachusetts, but also by more stringent underwriting standards on the part of insurers in the voluntary market.", "73": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t67Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nResidual Markets\nResidual Market Plan Mergers:   In 2002 Florida\u2019s two residual market \norganizations, the JUA and the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, \nmerged to become the Citizens\u2019 Property Insurance Corporation (CPIC). The Florida CPIC, known as Citizens, has a tax-exempt status. This feature enables it to finance loss payments in the event of a major disaster by issuing tax-exempt bonds that carry low interest rates, thus reducing financing costs over the years by hundreds of millions of dollars. In Louisiana, following Florida\u2019s model, the FAIR Plan and the Coastal Plan became the Louisiana Citizens Property Insur-ance Corporation in 2004.\nOther Residual Market Entities\nJUAs for Other Lines of Insurance: \n JUAs are not limited to automobile \ninsurance. At various times, there have been JUAs for residential insurance and \nworkers compensation. A number of states have medical malpractice JUAs, most of which were set up in the 1970s or 1980s when the line was beset by high losses.\nMarket Assistance Plans (MAPs):\n  A MAP is a temporary, voluntary clear-\ninghouse and referral system designed to put people looking for insurance in \ntouch with insurance companies. They are organized when something happens to cause insurance companies to cut back on the amount of insurance they are willing to provide. MAPs are generally administered by agents\u2019 associations, which assign insurance applications to a group of insurers doing business in a state. These companies have agreed to take their share of applicants on a rotat-ing basis.\nMAPs may be organized for a single line of insurance, such as daycare \nliability or homeowners insurance, or for a broad range of liability coverages. Homeowners insurance MAPs have been formed in several East Coast states, including Connecticut and Texas, and medical malpractice MAPs were created in states such as Washington, when the medical community had difficulty find-ing malpractice insurance.\nWorkers Compensation Assigned Risk Plans and Pools: \nThe mechanism used to handle the workers compensation residual market var-\nies from state to state. In the four remaining states with a monopolistic state workers compensation fund (North Dakota, Ohio, Washington and Wyoming switched to a competitive market in July 2008), all businesses are insured through that fund.

Reinsurers were unwilling to reinsure pol-icies in urban areas perceived to be vulnerable to attack. Primary insurers filed requests with their state insurance departments for permission to exclude terror-ism coverage from their commercial policies.\nConcerned about the limited availability of terrorism coverage in high-\nrisk areas and its impact on the economy, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). The Act provides a temporary program that, in the event of major terrorist attack, allows the insurance industry and federal government to share losses according to a specific formula. TRIA was signed into law on November 26, 2002 and renewed again for two years in December 2005. Passage of TRIA enabled a market for terrorism insurance to begin to develop because the federal backstop effectively limits insurers\u2019 losses, greatly simplifying the underwriting process. TRIA was extended for another seven years to 2014 in December 2007. The new law is known as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) of 2007.\nThe Difficulty of Insuring Terrorism Risk\n: From an insurance viewpoint, \nterrorism risk is very different from the kind of risks typically insured. To be \nreadily insurable, risks have to have certain characteristics. \nThe risk must be measurable. Insurers must be able to determine the pos-\nsible or probable number of events (frequency) likely to result in claims and the maximum size or cost (severity) of these events. For example, insurers know from experience about how many car crashes to expect per 100,000 miles driven for any geographic area and what these crashes are likely to cost. As a result they can charge a premium equal to the risk they are assuming in issuing an auto insurance policy. \nA large number of people or businesses must be exposed to the risk of loss \nbut only a few must actually experience one so that the premiums of those that do not file claims can fund the losses of those who do. Losses must be random as regards time, location and magnitude. \nInsofar as acts of terrorism are intentional, terrorism risk does not have \nthese characteristics. In addition, no one knows what the worst case scenario might be. There have been very few terrorist attacks, so there is little data on ", "76": "70  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceTerrorism Risk and Insurance\nwhich to base estimates of future losses, either in terms of frequency or severity. \nTerrorism losses are also likely to be concentrated geographically, since terrorism is usually targeted to produce a significant economic or psychological impact. This leads to a situation known in the insurance industry as adverse selection, where only the people most at risk purchase coverage, the same people who are likely to file claims. Moreover, terrorism losses are never random. They are care-fully planned and often coordinated.\nAssessing Risk\n: To underwrite terrorism insurance\u2014to decide whether to offer \ncoverage and what price to charge\u2014insurers must be able to quantify the risk: \nthe likelihood of an event and the amount of damage it would cause. Increas-ingly, they are using sophisticated modeling tools to assess this risk. According to the modeling firm, AIR Worldwide, the way terrorism risk is measured is not much different from assessments of natural disaster risk, except that the data used for terrorism are more subject to uncertainty. It is easier to project the risk of damage in a particular location from an earthquake of a given intensity or a Category 5 hurricane than a terrorist attack because insurers have had so much more experience with natural disasters than with terrorist attacks and therefore the data to incorporate into models are readily available. \nOne problem insurers face is the accumulation of risk. They need to know \nnot only the likelihood and extent of damage to a particular building but also the company\u2019s accumulated risk from insuring multiple buildings within a given geographical area, including the implications of fire following a terrorist attack. In addition, in the United States, workers compensation insurers face concentra-tions of risk from injuries to workers caused by terrorism attacks. Workers com-pensation policies provide coverage for loss of income and medical and rehabili-tation treatment from \u201cfirst dollar,\u201d that is without deductibles. \nExtending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA): There is general \nagreement that TRIA has helped insurance companies provide terrorism cover-\nage because the federal government\u2019s involvement offers a measure of certainty as to the maximum size of losses insurers would have to pay and allows them to plan for the future. However, when the Act came up for renewal in 2005 and in 2007, there were some who believed that market forces should be allowed to deal with the problem. \nBoth the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the President\u2019s \nWorking Group on Financial Markets published reports on terrorism insurance in September 2006. The two reports essentially supported the insurance indus-try in its evaluation of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) ", "77": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t71Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nTerrorism Risk and Insurance\nrisk\u2014that it is uninsurable\u2014but unlike the insurance industry, the President\u2019s \nWorking Group said that the existence of TRIA has negatively affected the development of a more robust market for terrorism insurance, a point on which the industry disagrees. TRIA is the reason that coverage is available, insurers say. The structure of the program has encouraged the development of reinsurance for the layers of risk that insurers must bear themselves\u2014deductible amounts and coinsurance\u2014which in turn allows primary insurers to provide coverage. \nTRIA and its extensions authorized the creation of a federal reinsurance \nplan, which is triggered when insured terrorism losses exceed a predetermined amount. The program, a sharing of losses between the insurance industry and the federal government according to a preset formula\u2014a type of reinsurance\u2014has enabled the commercial insurance market to function, even though the threat of terrorism remains. \nThe law defines an act of terrorism under the 2007 amendment. To be cov-\nered by the federal program, an act of terrorism must be committed by individu-als acting as part of an effort to influence the policy or conduct of the United States. The law also requires that the act be certified by the Secretary of the Treasury in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Insurers do not pay the federal government for this reinsurance coverage.\nOnly commercial insurers and causes of losses specified in the underlying \npolicies are covered. In addition to commercial lines insurers, insurers eligible for coverage include residual market entities such as workers compensation pools, state-licensed captive insurers and risk retention groups, see report on captives. Personal lines insurance companies\u2014those that sell auto and home insurance\u2014and reinsurers are not covered. Neither are group life insurance losses. Most types of commercial insurance losses were covered under the origi-nal legislation, except some specialty coverages such as medical malpractice and crop insurance. Some commercial insurance coverages were deleted under the 2005 extension including commercial auto insurance, professional liabil-ity except for directors and officers liability, surety, burglary and theft and farmowners multiperil, a coverage similar to homeowners. \nIn return for the federal backstop, commercial insurers must make terrorism \ncoverage available and conspicuously state the premium charges; policyhold-ers can reject the offer and choose to mitigate this class of risk in other ways. In offering terrorism coverage to their policyholders, commercial insurers must make it available on the same terms and conditions as they offer in their non-TRIA coverage. \nAfter September 11, to minimize the likelihood of a wave of liability claims, ", "78": "72  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceTerrorism Risk and Insurance\nCongress established the Federal Victims Compensation Act, which provided \nnearly $7 billion in payments to families of September 11 victims.

This means that in the event of a terrorist-caused explosion \nfollowed by fire, insurers could be liable to pay out losses attributable to the fire (but not the explosion) even if a commercial property owner had not purchased terrorism coverage.

It also compensates them for lost wages and provides death benefits for their dependents if they are killed in work-related accidents, including terrorist attacks. The workers compensation system is the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for on-the-job injuries suffered by employees. As part of the social contract embedded in each state\u2019s law, the employee gives up the right to sue the employer for injuries caused by the employer\u2019s negligence and in return receives workers compensation benefits regardless of who or what caused the accident, as long as it happened in the workplace as a result of and in the course of workplace activities.\nWorkers compensation systems vary from state to state. State statutes and \ncourt decisions control many aspects, including the handling of claims, the evaluation of impairment and settlement of disputes, the amount of benefits injured workers receive and the strategies used to control costs.\nWorkers compensation costs are one of the many factors that influence \nbusinesses to expand or relocate in a state, generating jobs. When premiums rise sharply, legislators often call for reforms. The last round of widespread reform legislation started in the late 1980s. In general, the reforms enabled employ-ers and insurers to better control medical care costs through coordination and oversight of the treatment plan and return-to-work process and to improve workplace safety. Some states are now approaching a crisis once again as new problems arise.\nThe Workers Compensation Social Contract:\n  The industrial expansion that \ntook place in the United States during the 19th century was accompanied by a \nsignificant increase in workplace accidents. At that time, the only way injured workers could obtain compensation was to sue their employers for negligence. Proving negligence was a costly, time-consuming effort, and often the court ruled in favor of the employer. But by the early 1900s, a state-by-state pattern of legisla -\ntive proposals designed to compensate injured workers had begun to emerge.\nWisconsin enacted the first permanent workers compensation insurance law \nin 1911 (New York had enacted a law a year earlier but it was found unconsti-tutional), and by 1920 all but eight states had enacted similar laws. By 1949 all states had a workers compensation system that provided compensation to work-ers hurt on the job, regardless of who was at fault. The costs of medical treat-ment and wage loss benefits were the responsibility of the employer which were paid through the workers compensation system. ", "80": "74  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceWorkers Compensation\nThe scope of workers compensation coverage has broadened consider-\nably since its early beginnings. In 1972, states amended their laws to meet \nperformance standards recommended by the National Commission on State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws. Many states took action not only to expand benefits but also to make the coverage applicable to classifications of employees not previously covered.\nHowever, compensation levels are not uniform. In some states benefits are \nstill inadequate, while in others, they are overly generous. Some states were slow in adopting the National Commission\u2019s guidelines and have still not embraced the entire package of 19 recommendations published in 1972. Many states exempt employers with only a few workers (fewer than five, four or three, depending on the state) from mandatory coverage laws. A major benefits issue still to be resolved in some states is the imbalance between levels of compensa-tion for various degrees of impairment; permanent partial disabilities tend to be overcompensated and permanent total disability undercompensated.\nSome coverage for workers compensation is provided by federal programs. \nFor example, the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, passed in 1927 and substantially amended in 1984, provides coverage for certain maritime employees and the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act protects workers hired by the U.S. government.\nEmployers can purchase workers compensation coverage from private insur-\nance companies or state-run workers agencies, known as state funds. In 14 states, state funds compete with private insurers (competitive funds) and in four states, the state is the sole provider of workers compensation insurance. State funds also function as the insurer of last resort for businesses that have diffi-culty getting coverage in the open market.\nThe only state in which workers compensation coverage is truly optional is \nTexas, where about one-third of the state\u2019s employers are so-called nonsubscrib-ers. Those that opt out of the system can be sued by employees for failure to provide a safe workplace. The nonsubscribers tend to be smaller companies, but the percentage of larger companies opting out has been growing.\nSome businesses finance their own workplace injury benefits through a \nsystem known as self-insurance. Large organizations with many employees can often estimate the cost of routine types of injuries. Self-insurance, along with large deductibles, which are in effect self-insurance, now account for more than one-third of traditional market premium.\nAbout nine out of 10 people in the nation\u2019s workforce are protected by \nworkers compensation insurance.", "81": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t75Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nWorkers Compensation\nHow the System Works:   Workers compensation systems are administered by \nthe individual states, generally by commissions or boards whose responsibility \nit is to ensure compliance with the laws, investigate and decide disputed cases, and collect data. In most states employers are required to keep records of acci-dents. Accidents must be reported to the workers compensation board and to the company\u2019s insurer within a specified number of days.\nWorkers compensation covers an injured worker\u2019s medical care and \nattempts to cover his or her economic loss. This includes loss of earnings and the extra expenses associated with the injury. Injured workers receive all medi-cally necessary and appropriate treatment from the first day of injury or illness and rehabilitation when the disability is severe.\nTo rein in expenditures and improve cost effectiveness, many states have \nadopted cost control measures, including treatment guidelines that spell out acceptable treatments and diagnostic tests for specific injuries such as lower back injuries and fee schedules that set maximum payment amounts to doctors for certain types of care.\nMost claims are medical only, but lost-time claims, those with both medi-\ncal and lost income payments, though few, consume most resources. Claims are categorized according to the degree of impairment\u2014partial or total disabil-ity\u2014and whether the impairment is permanent or temporary. Cash benefits can include impairment benefits and, when the impairment causes a loss of income, disability or wage loss benefits.\nImpairment can be defined in several ways. Payments may be based on a \nschedule or list of body parts covered and the benefits paid for a loss of that part. For injuries not on the schedule, benefit payments may be calculated according to the degree of impairment or the loss of future or current earnings capacity, often using the American Medical Association\u2019s definitions.\nMost states pay benefits for the duration of the injury. But some specify a \nmaximum number of weeks, particularly for temporary disabilities. For workers with a total disability, the benefit amount is some percentage of the worker\u2019s weekly wage (actual or state average). Cash benefits may not be paid until after a waiting period of several days.\nCosts to Employers: \n Costs to employers include premiums, payments made \nunder deductibles and the benefits and administrative costs incurred by employ-\ners that self-insure or fund their own benefit program. In the mid-1950s, private sector employers paid an average 0.5 percent of payroll for workers compensa-tion. By 1970 this figure was 1 percent. Employer costs escalated steeply in the 1980s and 1990s, reaching a record high in 1994 of 2.99 percent. Since then ", "82": "76  I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\tInsurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\nAuto InsuranceWorkers Compensation\nthey have fluctuated. Estimates by John Burton in the Workers Compensa-\ntion Policy Review, January/February 2008 put workers compensation costs as a percentage of payroll in 2007 at 2.28, up from a 10-year low of 1.92 in 2001. The NCCI estimates that in 2008 employers\u2019 workers compensation insurance costs accounted for 1.7 percent of total compensation costs.   However, there is \na wide variation in costs among states and industries, so that the highest rated (the inherent riskiest) groups could pay several hundred times that of the lowest rated (safest) groups, as a percentage of payroll. Also taken into account is the firm\u2019s own safety record.\nReducing Costs: \n Workers compensation system costs are rarely static. \nReforms are implemented and then, over time, one or more elements in these \nmultifaceted systems get out of balance. Some employers and legislators com-plain that the cost of coverage is hurting the state\u2019s economy by reducing its ability to compete with other states for new job-producing opportunities.\nIn the 1980s, with a view to increasing competition within the insurance \nindustry in order to bring down rates, legislation was introduced in more than a dozen states to change the method of establishing rates from administered pric-ing, where rating organizations recommended rates that included expenses and a margin for profit, to open competition. Now insurers base their rate filings on more of their own company\u2019s specific data, rather than using industrywide figures in such areas as expenses and profit and contingency allowances. Rating organizations still provide industrywide data on \u201closses\u201d\u2014the costs associated with work-related accidents, which help small companies that lack access to large amounts of data.\nThe aim of the workers compensation system is to help workers recover \nfrom work-related accidents and illnesses and to return to the workplace. A fast return to work is desirable from the employer and insurer\u2019s viewpoint, lowering claim costs for the insurer but benefiting the worker too.\nAnother factor pushing up costs in some states is the amount of attorney \ninvolvement. Workers compensation programs were originally intended to be \u201cno-fault\u201d systems and therefore litigation-free.\nHowever today, attorneys are involved in 5 to 10 percent of all workers \ncompensation claims in most states\u2014but in as much as 20 percent in systems where the number of disputes is high and in roughly a third of claims where the worker was injured seriously.\nAlthough attorney involvement boosts claim costs by 12 to 15 percent, \nbecause claimants must pay attorneys\u2019 fees there is generally no net gain in ", "83": "Insurance Topics  Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates\n\t I.I.I.\tInsurance\tHandbook\t\t\twww.iii.org/insurancehandbook\t \t77Auto InsuranceUpdates at www.iii.org/issues_updates   Insurance Topics\nWorkers Compensation\nthe actual benefits received. The involvement of an attorney does not necessar-\nily indicate formal litigation proceedings. Sometimes, injured workers turn to attorneys to help them negotiate what they believe is a confusing and complex system. Increasingly, states are trying to make the system easier to understand and to use.\nThe workers compensation system plays a major role in improving work-\nplace safety. An employer\u2019s workers compensation premium reflects the relative hazards to which workers are exposed and the employer\u2019s claim record. About one-half of states allow what is known as \u201cschedule rating,\u201d a discount or rate credit for superior workplace safety programs.\nWorkers Compensation Residual Markets: Residual markets, traditionally \nthe market of last resort, are an important segment of the workers comp market. \nWorkers comp residual plans are administered by the NCCI in 29 jurisdictions. In some states, particularly where rates in the voluntary market are inadequate, the residual market provides coverage for a large portion of policyholders.\nTerrorism Coverage: Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, work-\ners compensation insurers have been taking a closer look at their exposures to \ncatastrophes, both natural and man-made. According to a report by Risk Man-agement Solutions, if the earthquake that shook San Francisco in 1906 were to happen today, it could cause as many as 78,000 injuries, 5,000 deaths and over $7 billion in workers compensation losses.\nWorkers compensation claims for terrorism could cost an insurer anywhere \nfrom $300,000 to $1 million per employee, depending on the state. As a result, firms with a concentration of employees in a single building in major metro-politan areas, such as New York, or near a \u201ctrophy building\u201d are now considered high risk, a classification that used to apply only to people in dangerous jobs such as roofing. \nSTATES WITH A STATE-RUN WORKERS COMPENSATION FUND\nCompetitive with Private Insurers Exclusive\nArizona* Maryland Oregon North Dakota\nCalifornia Minnesota Pennsylvania Ohio\nColorado Montana Texas Washington\nIdaho New York Utah Wyoming**\nKentucky Oklahoma West Virginia  \n*Scheduled to be privatized by 2013.  \n**Compulsory for extra hazardous operations only.

For an \nindividual insurer, the maximum amount \nof risk it can underwrite based on its finan-cial condition. The adequacy of an insurer\u2019s capital relative to its exposure to loss is an \nimportant measure of solvency. A property/\ncasualty insurer must maintain a certain \nlevel of capital and policyholder surplus to \nunderwrite risks. This capital is known as \ncapacity. When the industry is hit by high \nlosses, such as after the World Trade Center \nterrorist attack, capacity is diminished. It \ncan be restored by increases in net income, \nfavorable investment returns, reinsuring more risk and or raising additional capi-\ntal. When there is excess capacity, usually \nbecause of a high return on investments, \npremiums tend to decline as insurers com-pete for market share. As premiums decline, \nunderwriting losses are likely to grow, \nreducing capacity and causing insurers \nto raise rates and tighten conditions and \nlimits in an effort to increase profitability. \nPolicyholder surplus is sometimes used as a \nmeasure of capacity. \nCAPITAL\nShareholder\u2019s equity (for publicly traded in-\nsurance companies) and retained earnings \n(for mutual insurance companies).

Insurers\u2019 \nability and willingness to sell insurance \nfluctuates with the availability and cost \nof catastrophe reinsurance. After major disasters, such as Hurricane Andrew and \nthe World Trade Center terrorist attack, the availability of catastrophe reinsurance \nbecomes extremely limited. Claims \ndeplete reinsurers\u2019 capital and, as a result, companies are more selective in the type \nand amount of risks they assume.

Factors considered include company earnings, capital adequa-\ncy, operating leverage, liquidity, investment \nperformance, reinsurance programs, and \nmanagement ability, integrity and experi-\nence. \nRATING BUREAU \nThe insurance business is based on the \nspread of risk. The more widely risk is spread, the more accurately loss can be \nestimated. An insurance company can \nmore accurately estimate the probability of loss on 100,000 homes than on ten. Years \nago, insurers were required to use standard-\nized forms and rates developed by rating \nagencies. Today, large insurers use their \nown statistical loss data to develop rates. \nBut small insurers, or insurers focusing on \nspecial lines of business, with insufficiently \nbroad loss data to make them actuarially re-\nliable depend on pooled industry data col-lected by such organizations as ISO, which \nprovides information to help develop rates \nsuch as estimates of future losses and loss \nadjustment expenses like legal defense \ncosts. \nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS\nInvestments generally owned by life insur-\ners that include commercial mortgage loans \nand real property. \nRECEIVABLES\nAmounts owed to a business for goods or \nservices provided.\nREDLINING\nLiterally means to draw a red line on a map around areas to receive special treatment.

The study employed secondary annual data over  35 years from 1985 to 2016. A dummy variable was introduced to incorporate the impact of war period. The multiple regression models confirmed that only the exchange rate was significant, the inflation and population of the country were found insignificant in determining FDI inflow. A long-run association within all four variables was found through the Johansen Cointegration test. Further, a causal relationship was found between exchange rate and FDI through the Granger Causality test. Only exchange rate was identified to have a significant relationship with FDI, and it showed a high degree of positive correlation.  Primary data analysis showed the preference of investors from the most preferred to the least; exchange rate, inflation, GDP, and population, respectively. In conclusion, both Model-A and Model-B concluded that the exchange rate has a significant relationship with FDI.  Keywords: Foreign Direct Investment, Gross Domestic Production, Inflation, Population, Macro-economic Variables. 1. Introduction It is widely regarded that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a major source of external financing, especially for developing economies. Generally, FDI is recognized as an investment involving acquiring or creation of assets that is undertaken by foreign investors or a joint venture with local governments with the main aim of creating a long-term relationship.  ", "6": " \n2  In other words, FDI is the international capital flows from one country to another country in order to get an advantage from investment opportunities and to deliver positive production effect for the host country. Moreover, FDI has become instrumental   in economic growth of a country anywhere in the world. One of the main economic problems faced by the developing economies is the lack of national savings to finance their potential investments. Therefore, governments are constantly looking for foreign capital investments at their top priority. In addition to that most governments seek loans from international financial institutions which will further aggravate the debt burden to the economy. As a result, governments prefer a comparatively easier source of financing; which is FDI. The realization of the benefit package that tags along with the capital inflow has made FDIs more attractive for economies. Infrastructural developments, employment opportunities, new technology, and human capital, are few of the positive inflows to the host country from FDI inflows. It is visible that significant changes are being proposed on government policies and regulations to encourage FDI flows across nations.. However, the effectiveness  of these amendments is still open to discussion and  it requires further objective verification for policy implications.  Flow of literature in this premise shows that many researchers have focused the studies to explore  the determinants of FDI inflow to a country and  there is no common consciences over the factors determining FDI. However, there are several theories which attempt to explain the determinants of FDI. According to Lipsey (2001), macroeconomic theories explain factors  motivating investors to invest in foreign countries, explain the phenomena associated with the macro-economy.  Macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic production, exchange rate, inflation, population, labor force, economic growth and interest rate affects the host country\u2019s FDI flows. Sri Lanka being a country, full of natural resources  with a high growth potentials, should have attracted more foreign investors.  However, when making their investment decisions foreign investors practically consider a wide range of other factors, such as demographic variables, macroeconomic policy, credibility, and good governance. Therefore, what attract FDIs to a country is yet to be scientifically explored. This is an important question that should be answered by every government in the effort of attracting more FDIs. Therefore, identification of the determinants and managing them properly may assist in attracting more FDIs to the host countries. There is a paucity of research conducted investigating the ", "7": " \n3  relationship between these variables and the FDIs in the Sri Lankan context. Accordingly, it has been identified as a research gap of this paper.   Thus, the objectives of the study are  to examine the impact of selected macro- economic variables on foreign direct investments and to explore the perception of foreign investors who have already invested in Sri Lanka in making investment decisions. 2. Literature Review FDI has now become one of the most demanded sources of finance for countries. Parvin (2013) stated that the main purpose of FDI inflow to a country is to have access to natural resources, market size, geographic locations, and low labor cost. Moreover, Dunning (2009) and Kosekahyaoglu (2006) pointed out that FDIs induce total demand for domestic goods and foster technology transformation. Also, Aremu (2005) examined the growing interest  in FDIs and  the perceived opportunities derived from the utilization of foreign capital injection into the economy. Moreover, Arbatili (2011)  stated that it provides many development options for the host country and  stable FDIs inflow  creates a barrier against reversals in portfolio inflows during crisis periods. Further, empirical evidence suggests that FDI as  an important source of capital, complements domestic private investments, , creates new employment  opportunities enrich technology transfer and boosts economic growth in host countries (Chowdhury and Mavrotas, 2003). Host countries are using policy incentives such as granting tax allowances and  other facilities to attract and retain FDIs into their economies. Bilawal, et.al. (2014) proposed that FDI flows help to build strong economic ties between developing and industrialized nations. It is generally believed that gross domestic savings in least developed countries are very low. Therefore, FDI is an alternative mechanism  to fill  the saving and investment gaps in those countries.   However, there are also counter arguments forwarded by many scholars discussing the negative influence from FDI to the host country. That is FDI might lower or replace domestic assets and investment, transfer low level or unsuitable technologies for the host countries and can even slower the development of local firms, limiting growth their growth opportunities. Certainly, initial investment of foreign firms improves the current and the capital account of the host country. However, in the long run, substantial import of intermediate and capital goods, repatriation of profit, interest, royalties and management ", "8": " \n4  fees may harmfully affect the foreign exchange position of the host country (Organization for Economic Operation Development, 2002).  Nevertheless, the negative consequences of FDI can be controlled with proper trade and labor regulations (Rose and Mwega, 2006; Kinuthia, 2010). FDI can also be classified into market-seeking, export- oriented and government initiated FDI. A market-seeking FDI is highly determined by the growth potential and the size of national market, access to regional & global markets and country-specific consumer preferences. When a foreign firm produces raw materials, intermediate and final goods and sells these products for non-local market, this FDI is referred as export-oriented FDI. An investment is called government initiated FDI, when governments of developing countries invite and give incentives to direct foreign investors to invest in specific sectors and industries with a view to addressing socio-economic problems like unemployment, regional disparities and deficits in the balance of payment (Accolley et al, 1997). However, Pradhan (2001) stated that Sri Lanka has great potential to become an international business hub with the wealth of human capital and geographical location. Trade liberalization policy adapted in 1977 has created an enabling environment for the foreign investors to invest in Sri Lanka. The intention of this move has been to bring the country as one of the most open economies in South Asia, which has created the significance of FDIs to the country. Athukorala and Rajapathirana, (2000) discussed liberalization and industrial transformation in Sri Lanka, considering the first decade of Sri Lankan market after independence in 1948. However, Athukorala, (2003) forwarded a study to explore the role of FDI in economic growth, in Sri Lanka and stated a robust link between FDI and growth in Sri Lanka. Added to this Balamurali and Bogahawatte, (2004) carried out a study on FDI and economic growth in Sri Lanka. Athukorala & Jayasuriya (2004) discussed complementarity of trade and FDI liberalization in Sri Lanka referring to the trade liberalization in 1975 and then the introduction of market oriented policy reforms in 1977.  Rauf (2016) compared influence of exchange rate on FDI and concluded that there is no any relationship between FDI and exchange rate. It also explored that the government should attract more FDIs, to maintain a stable exchange rate. It further evidences that currencies appreciate and depreciate according to prevailing Market conditions (Kabura 2013). One of the many influences on foreign direct investment activity is the behavior of ", "9": " \n5  exchange rates. This is because the exchange rates can influence equally the total amount of foreign direct investment that takes place as well as the allocation of this investment spending across a range of countries. Oude (2013) highlights that the exchange rate fluctuations are mainly caused by the changes in the demand and supply of the money in the FOREX market. Inflation Rate acts as a signaling mechanism to both foreign investors and local investors, to make their investment decisions. The relationship however has not yet been clearly stated. According to Sajid et. al (2012) where they have analyzed the role of FDI and trade on the growth in Pakistan, results indicated a positive and not statistically significant relationship between inflation and the FDI. Moreover, Djokoto (2012) investigated the effects of investment promotion on foreign direct investment inflow in Ghana for the period 1970 to 2009 and discovered a negative relationship between inflation and the FDI. The FDI inflow is significantly related with the economic condition of a country. If the economic condition of a country is healthy, then FDI inflow will be more and with that the retention time period of the investments would be longer. On the other hand, Todaro and Smith (2007) defined it as a steady process by which the productive capacity of an economy is increased overtime to ensure raising levels of national output and income while Jhingan (2003) defines it as a quantitative sustained increase in the country\u2019s per-capita income accompanied by the capital, expansion, and volume of trade. Many researches on the factors that influence FDI have ignored the role of population of a country. According to Abdul and Bilal (2012), such neglect seems to be motivated by the theoretical support for the assumption that large population is likely to be negatively related to the economic growth. Based on a review of the latest research on the role of population in economic growth and the determinants of FDI, it was hypothesized that a country\u2019s population would be related to the FDI. Along with the density of the population, other related factors like labor force, market size and labor cost differ. China and India produce five million and three million graduates respectively each year (Gupta and Wang, 2009). Yet the demand for highly trained professionals is still far greater than the supply. The cost of these professionals for a multinational corporation is much lower than employing home country nationals, but scarcity has contributed to a rapid increase in the cost of technical and managerial personnel.

Methodology Since the study comprises a large representative sample, secondary data collection, and analysis methods such as correlation analysis, and regression analysis were used to test specific hypotheses of the study. The authors have identified this requirement of analyzing quantitative data under Model-A. In addition, a qualitative approach has been used in this study to gain a further understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations of the foreign investors. For this purpose, we introduced Model-B to the study. 3.1 Sources of Data  The study employed both primary and secondary data. Secondary data was obtained from the Central bank of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka National Bureau of Statistics, and the World Bank Indicators (WDI). Primary data was collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews with selected foreign investors to provide insights into the research problem and  assist  in developing  hypotheses for potential quantitative research done.  3.2 Sample and Data Collection The study employed a mixed approach. Therefore, the research utilizes both secondary and primary data. Secondary data was analyzed under Model-A, and Primary data was analyzed under Model-B. Due to the limitation of access to data, annual data from all the companies who have invested in Sri Lanka from 1985 to 2016 were considered, and this time range consists of both the post-war and pre-war periods. In Model-B, primary data have been collected through several face-to-face semi-structured interviews conducted with selected foreign investors. The study applied the convenient sampling technique.  The preliminary study for the research was conducted using secondary data sources such as previous literature to identify the type of data, sources of data, and the frequency of data required. We identified two models based on the type of data as Model-A and Model-B. Based on that, secondary data were collected from respective data sources, which are annual data (Model-A). Further, primary data were gathered through face-to-face semi-structured interviews carried out across a selected sample of investors (Model-B). Model-B consists of primary data, which were collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews with selected foreign investors from 10 different organizations in Sri ", "11": " \n7  Lanka with the aim to enriching the findings of Model-A. The following 10 Companies were selected for this purpose; Table 1: Selected Companies for the Interview   Company Name   Sector / Industry Origin Country AVIC International Corperation Ltd Service - IT Consulting Services China Hotel Riu Sri Lanka Service - Hotel Industry Spain Skyway Seafoods Specialist (Pvt) Ltd Service - Hotel Industry China Dialog Axiata PLC Service - Telecommunication Malaysia Moody's Corporation Service - Financial Services USA Zylan Luxury Villa Service - Hotel Industry Thailand Shangri-La Hotels & Resorts service - Hotel Industry Hong-Kong John Keels Holdings Service/Manufacturing Multi national Taj Samudra Hotel Service - Hotel Industry Manufacturing - Food & India Nestle Lanka Beverage. Switzerland 3.3 Analysis Tools Using the original data series descriptive analysis was derived to get an overview of the entire model. Through this, detailed information about each variable was derived including mean, standard deviation, minimum value, and the maximum value of the data series.  To address the main objective of the study, the impact of selected macroeconomic variables on the FDI to Sri Lanka needs to be analyzed. Therefore Multiple regression analysis was carried out to identify the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable as suggested by Kwoba & Kibati (2016). To find the long-term association between all the four variables, Johansen cointegration test was used as suggested by Khan and Mitra (2014). Trace test and Maximum Eigen Value statistic have been used for this purpose. Since, four endogenous variables were taken into consideration, there were three cointegration relations. Eviews software was used for this analysis. Subsequently, to identify the causality between macroeconomic determinants and the FDI in Sri Lanka from 1986 to 2016, the Pair-wise two way Granger Causality test was used as suggested by Maku (2015), which is  a short run approach.  To establish the degree of relationship within two variables, Karl Pearson\u2019s correlation test was used as suggested by Kirthika & Nirmala (2014). Here, the study tested whether there ", "12": " \n8  is a correlation between the two variables. Model-B; feedback from ten foreign investors have been summarized and converted in to the percentage values by converting them into a fraction from the total and multiplying by hundred. 4. Results and Discussion The Multiple Regression Analysis results are shown in Table 3, the exchange rate was the only significant variable which determine the FDI, have a positive relationship. The exchange rate has a P-value of 0.0011, which is lesser than 0.05, and a t-statistic of 7.7028, which is higher than 2. A lesser P-value than 0.05 and a higher t-statistic than 2 denote that the independent variable  significantly  influences  the dependent variable. Outcomes from the regression model showed a +0.04 coefficient amount for exchange rate, which means a 4% increase in the FDI per every unit of increase in the exchange rate. An increase in the exchange rate refers to a depreciation of the local currency. In other words, the number of rupees paid in exchange for a dollar will be increased. Therefore, Sri Lanka becomes costly for local investors and cheaper for foreign investors. This attracts the FDI since foreign investors may find Sri Lanka as a cheaper location to invest in. This finding is consistent with the findings of Ibrahim et al, (2014). GDP, Inflation, and Population, were found insignificant to determine the FDIs; however, this complies with the findings of Kwoba & Kibati (2016). GDP was omitted from the model due to the multicollinearity issue. Inflation and population were found insignificant in determining the FDI inflow. The dummy variable, which represents the war period, was found significant, which means that war showed an impact on the FDI inflow, and it showed a negative impact on the FDI. The model is significant, and it could explain 68% of the variation in the FDI. Therefore, the exchange rate and the dummy variable explain 68% of the FDI\u2019s behavior while the remaining 38% is explained by the other factors, which are not included in the model. The DW statistic was found 1.87, which is closer to two, which means that the model is free from autocorrelation, and the f-statistic of 17.00798, which is higher than one conveyed homoscedasticity. According to the regression output Population and Inflation are not significant and they have been removed from the model and the estimated revised regression equation is as follows.

Table 4 presents the long-run association among the variables which was identified by utilizing Johansen Cointegration test, and both the trace test and maximum eigenvalue were tested. The trace test resulted in two cointegrating equations, which denoted the rejection of null hypothesis at 0.05 level. This means that there is a  long-run association among the variables. In other words, all four variables move together in the long-run. The maximum eigenvalue test indicated one cointegration equation at the 0.05 level, which denoted rejection of the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level. This means that there is a long run association among the variables or in other words all four variables move together in the long run.

Therefore, according to Table 6, the first null hypothesis is exchange rate does not granger cause the FDI. It has an f-statistic of 4.3762 and a P-value of 0.0240. The P-value of 0.0240 is less than 0.05, which means that we must reject the null hypothesis, meaning, we reject the statement; the Exchange rate does not granger cause the FDI. Therefore, we accept the alternative hypothesis, which means exchange rate granger causes the FDI. The rest of the variables were found P-Value higher than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted. Thus, as per the Granger Causality test results, only the exchange rate data series affects or contributes in forecasting the FDI. Further, since the rest of the null hypotheses were accepted, it denotes that the GDP, Inflation, and Population do not contribute in resulting the dependent variable, FDI.

According to Table 7, the Pearson value for the exchange rate is 0.765, which shows a high degree of positive correlation between the exchange rate and the FDI. The P-value for this variable is 0.011, which is less than 0.05. This explains that there is a significant relationship between the exchange rate and the FDI. However, the rest of the variables resulted in a p-value higher than 0.05, proving an insignificant relationship. Therefore, to conclude the results of the Pearson correlation test, GDP, Population, and Inflation do not have a significant relationship with the FDI and only exchange rate has a significant relationship with the FDI.

Model B resulted in the responses from the interviewed foreign investors (See Table 8). Each investor was interviewed focusing the four selected macroeconomic variables. Importantly, 2 out of 10 interviewees, that is, 20% has considered the GDP of Sri Lanka, and only one out of 10, that is, 10%, has considered population as an influencing factor when making their investment decisions in Sri Lanka. Inflation and exchange rate had a higher percentage, which denotes that most of the investors have found these factors as significant in making their investment decisions. The inflation rate was considered by six investors out of 10, and the exchange rate was considered by seven investors out of 10. One of the main findings from the interviews was that the perception of foreign investors differs from industry to industry as well as it depends on the focused market that they cater. A group of 10 interviewees from diverse  industries that operate in Sri Lanka were selected for the study.  ", "16": " \n12  Other than these four variables, there were other macro-economic factors which the foreign investors  consider when making  investment decisions in Sri Lanka. Tax regimes and policies, government stability and predictability, skilled labor force, geographical location, output supply and demand, infrastructure, competitive advantage, and the availability of natural resources. The majority of responses denoted competitive advantage, geographical location, and government stability as factors considered by investors when making the decision to invest in Sri Lanka. Investors also responded to the war situation that prevailed in Sri Lanka, the majority of the respondents did not find a huge impact on their operations or  investments. However, there was poor denying of the impact of the war situation, and rather the investors mentioned that the impact was not significant; therefore, it did not affect their investment decisions. 20% of the responses depict that there was an impact from the war situation and the rest of 80% said that there was no major impact. To conclude the analysis of Model B with regards to the macro-economic variables selected. Most investors perceived exchange rate as the most important factor for the investment (70%) followed by inflation rate (60%), the GDP (20%), and Population (10%). The geographical location, competitive advantage, and infrastructure were the major influential factors that the investors considered highly in making their investment decisions. The impact of war did not have much influence on investment decisions as most of the investors pointed out. Table 8: Preference of Foreign Investors   Independent Variables Preference of independent variables by foreign investors (as a % of sample) GDP 20% Population 10% Inflation 60% Exchange Rate 70% Therefore,  the study suggested that the exchange rate was significant to determine the FDIs in Sri Lanka, and a positive relationship was established. On the other hand, the other macroeconomic variables, GDP, Inflation, and Population, were insignificant in determining the FDIs. Interestingly, the results contend that there is a long-run association between the macroeconomic variables and the FDIs. It is also found that exchange rate granger cause with the FDIs while the other macroeconomic factors, GDP, Inflation. and Population, does not granger cause with the ", "17": " \n13  FDIs. Very importantly, the results with the secondary data (Model \u2013 A) supported the findings of primary data (Model \u2013 B.) analysis.  The most influential factors for  foreign investors were the exchange rate and inflation. This suggests that the inflation and exchange rate determine the FDIs movements in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, additional factors, which investors had considered in their investment decisions were revealed through the interviews such as infrastructure, competitive advantage, skilled labor, geographical location, and so on. 5. Conclusion In this paper, the researcher had initially identified four macroeconomic variables to determine the FDI inflow to Sri Lanka: GDP, Inflation, Population, and Exchange Rate. Two models used as Model-A and Model-B for the ease of analysis of data. Augmented Dicky-fuller test was run to identify the stationarity of the data set, Multiple regression was run to identify the significance of the model, Johansen cointegration was run to identify the long-run association, causality relationship was tested through Granger Causality test, and finally Pearson correlation was considered to identify the correlation among the variables.  The Model-A; aimed at identifying the impact of the above mentioned variables on the FDI. Out of the four variables, only Exchange Rate was significant in determining FDI while GDP, Population, and Inflation were insignificant in  determining the FDI inflow in Sri Lanka, which concluded that only the Exchange Rate impacts  the FDI. GDP was identified with multicollinearity effect, therefore omitted from the final regression model. The study has also focused on identifying the causal relationship between dependent variables and independent variables. Only Exchange Rate was identified to granger cause the FDI while for the rest of the variables; FDI granger cause GDP, Inflation and Population, which means the direction of impact is from the FDI to above-mentioned variables. Results stated that there was an impact from the war situation to the FDI inflow in Sri Lanka. Moreover, the paper also targeted at identifying the long-run association between macro-economic variables and the FDI. Findings stated that variables are cointegrated, and therefore, there is a long-run association within all four variables and all four variables showed that move together in the long-run. The researcher also aimed to explore the perception of foreign investors as if why they have selected Sri Lanka as an investment destination. Model-B concluded that the majority of foreign investors found the ", "18": " \n14  Exchange Rate and Inflation as  important determinants of the FDI, which also had strengthened the findings in  Model-A. The findings will give practical implications for various parties. Foreign investors identified the infrastructure, interest rate, trade openness, foreign exchange reserves, and unemployment as the major influential factors in determining the FDI inflows in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to take steps for infrastructural developments and establish better political stability in the country, which lead to attracting more investors. As the investment decision making seems to be in the long run, the study also proposes the inclusion of the exchange rate movements via systematic exchange rate (monetary) policy to promote an attractive long-term  FDI for a country in order to achieve sustainable economic development.

Department of Accountancy and Finance, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka Shay.wijekoon@gmail.com *  Abstract  The aim of this study is to examine the impact of dividend policy and corporate governance on firm performance of listed manufacturing companies in Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) for the 5 year period from 2012-2016. This study pays the attention on the impact of three aspects of manufacturing companies which can cause economic decline or success. For this purpose, 33 manufacturing companies listed in the CSE are selected based on data availability for 5 years. The performance measurements are return on equity and return on assets and dividend policy is measured by dividend payout ratio and earning per share while corporate governance is measured by board size, board independence, CEO duality and number of board meetings. Panel data regression model is used as it has cross sections and time series nature of data. The study finds that the dividend policy variables are enough to describe the firm performance. On the other hand, corporate governance practices also had an impact on firm performance in listed manufacturing companies in the CSE in Sri Lanka. The findings will guide decision makers, future and potential investors, econometricians, academics and other stakeholders for making their strategic planning, cost controlling, profit allocation, related academic studies, taking decisions on managerial implications of economy and manufacturing sector.

The surplus can be paid back to its investors as dividends and/or firm can retain profits within the business as an addition to shareholders\u2019 equity as retained earnings. It may however decide to apportion the surplus to both. Earnings are the free cash flows allocated to the investors after all expenses and taxes have been paid. If the firm decides to redistribute the earnings to the investors, then the investors can decide whether to reinvest it themselves or spend it.  Priya & Nimalathasan (2013) propose that the divided policy is an ordinary tool of wealth distribution to its shareholders than  a tool of wealth formation to stakeholders. When a company is defining the value of the firm, the dividend policy is one of the irrelevant aspects (Modgliani & Miller, 1961). The agency cost concept proposes that, dividend policy is governed by the agency costs which arise from the disagreement of ownership and control and ownership. Managers cannot always implement a dividend policy which is value-maximizing for its shareholders. However, a dividend policy which maximizes their private benefits should be selected. Creation of dividend payouts that decreases the free cash flows which is available to the managers, should confirm that managers maximize shareholders\u2019 wealth other than consuming the funds for their own personal benefits (De Angelo, De Angelo & Stulz, 2006). Investors always prefer higher current income and try to find limited capital progress prefer companies with a high dividend payout. However, investors looking for higher capital growth may prefer a lower payout as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Barron (2002) defines dividends as one of the most important things to its investors since, it gives the signs that a company is creating profits. Firms policies vary from company to company. Among those policies dividend policy is one of the most significant new items. Cash divided plays a vital role among the shareholders as well as dividend policy affects  the firms\u2019 valuation. However, implementing a policy of divided is a crucial problem faced by companies. One of the main factors which determine the dividend policy is corporate governance (Mehrani, et al, 2011). Over the years, many studies have been investigating whether there is a relationship among firm performance, divided policy and corporate governance. Corporate Governance becomes the widely discussed common topic in modern economy. Simply, Corporate Governance is a method of governing the company. Generally, Corporate Governance includes rules, ", "23": " \n19  procedures, processors for strengthening management functions and accountability. Modern corporate governance started in 1992 with the Cadbury report in UK which was the result of several high profile company collapses. Corporate Governance is defined in the Cadbury (1992) as the system by which companies are directed and controlled. The Cadbury Code deals with the structure and responsibilities of the board of directors, the role of auditors, and the rights and responsibilities of shareholders. Currently, corporate governance practices of Sri Lankan listed companies are governed by the mandatory corporate governance rules included in the) listing rules. These rules on corporate governance have been incorporated into the CSE listing rules from 2007 and made mandatory for listed companies from April 2008. These mandatory rules have been developed jointly by the Institute of the Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (ICASL) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) in consultation with the CSE. The first Sri Lankan corporate governance code was announced in 1997 by the ICASL. The ICASL jointly with the SEC issued revised (1997, 2003) Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance October 2008 to be complied voluntarily by the companies in conjunction with the mandatory rules. Today, the manufacturing sector is playing a vital role in the world economy since the industrial revolution and it has a great ability to achieve a high rate of economic growth specially which has been confirmed by many experienced developed economies in the world. The manufacturing sector has been one of the significant contributors to the nation\u2019s Gross National Product (GNP) in Sri Lanka. Good governance concept has given much importance for the  past few years to analyze its effects on performance of the firms in academic research.   The dividend policy remains as an unresolved problem in corporate finance and many scholars have carried out studies on this topic by Farsio, Geary & Moser (2004), Arnott & Asness (2003) and Nissim & Ziv (2001). Some theories were tested by some researchers to clarify the relevance and significance of dividend policy and whether it affects firm value, but still there is no any universal agreement (Stulz, 2000, De Angelo et al., 2006, Pandey, 2005). Previous scholars namely Amidu (2007), Zhou & Ruland (2006), Lie (2005), Howatt (2002), came up with different judgements about the relationship between dividend policy and firm performance.  ", "24": " \n20  Numerous studies (Arnott et al., 2003; Nissim et al., 2001; Farsio, Geary et al., 2004) have been focused on the dividend policy and firm performance, but specially in developed economies. But these conclusions and findings of those studies directly cannot be replicated in developing countries. It is found that in Sri Lanka, there is lack of such studies to establish the relationship between corporate governance, dividend payout and firm profitability. The extant literature reveals that empirical studies have been conducted in different countries under various economic and social conditions. Sri Lanka is under different economic, social and technological conditions and it is immensely important to carry out this type of study in Sri Lanka. Thus, this study fill the gap by investigating \u201cwhat is the impact of dividend policy and corporate governance on firm performance of listed manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka?\u201d Thus, the main objective of the study is to investigate the impact of dividend policy and corporate governance on firm\u2019s performance of manufacturing companies listed in the CSE. The paper is organized as follows; Section 2 is devoted to a review of the literature that examines how theories of dividend policy and corporate governance can be applied in the context of different countries and industrial sectors. Section 3 discusses the data and methodology while section 4 presents the results and discussions. The last section concludes the paper.   2. Literature Review  Dividend Policy and firm Performance As Hafeez & Attiya, (2009) defined the dividend policy behavior as one of the most debatable issues in the corporate finance literature and both in developed and emerging markets it still remains  in a prominent place. Dividend policy and the firm performance have been analyzed for many decades, but up to now there is no universally accepted standard justification for companies\u2019 observed dividend payout (Samuel & Edward, 2011). Many researchers have given an effort to find issues regarding the dividend dynamics and determining factor of dividend policy. However, still there is no standard justification for the dividend behavior of firms (Brealey & Myers, 2005). Al-Malkawi (2007) took 15 years data with 1137 observations of Jordanian public listed companies and it is said that companies which have a growth of the profitability motivate to pay more dividends than others. The findings of the study made an argument with the ", "25": " \n21  study of Aivazian, Booth & Clearly (2003) which described the signaling theory and companies with higher profits allure to pay more dividends to the shareholders by sending a message of good financial performance of the companies. Gupta and Banga (2010) used the sample of  seven years data from 150 listed Indian companies on Bombay Stock Exchange. The results of the investigation showed that company performance and dividend policy had a significantly negative relationship. The same relationship is shown in other studies such as Aurangzeb & Dilawer (2012), Bacon & Kania (2005). This implies that the companies with more profits have a preference to pay less dividends to the shareholders. Rozeff (1982) explained that if there are more growth opportunities, companies which generate higher profits, like to reinvest in future projects to develop the business. Therefore, this study shows a positive relationship between company\u2019s profitability and its dividend policy. Corporate Governance and firm Performance  The concept of \u201ccorporate governance\u201d has attracted various definitions. Cadbury Committee (1992) defines corporate governance as \u201cthe system by which companies are directed and controlled\u201d. This corporate governance concept depends on the willingness for transparency, better management should be allowed first and then reconciliation of possibly divergent interests within the firm. Therefore, it is essential, after the recent world economy being recently turmoil, to restore confidence to the different stakeholders (Azhaar & Marjene, 2011). Corporate governance involves a set of relationships between a company\u2019s board, management, its shareholders and all other stakeholders (OECD 2004). Corporate governance emerges as a result of separation of ownership and control. Based on that, agency theory was developed by Jensen et al., (1976).  Corporate governance initiatives in Sri Lanka commenced in 1997 with the introduction of a voluntary code of best practices on matters relating to the financial aspects of corporate governance. Voluntary codes of best practices on corporate governance were issued in 2003 and in 2007 corporate governance standards were become mandatory for all listed companies for the financial year commencing on or after 1st April 2008. The new Companies Act No. 07 was enacted in 2007 to keep abreast with prevalent international laws and to safeguard the interest of all stakeholders including directors, major shareholders, minority shareholders and creditors. The act introduced greater protection to minority shareholders, director\u2019s duties, and transparency and accountability. The new ", "26": " \n22  Company Act No. 7 was based on Canadian, New Zealand and other modern practices. It became operative for all listed companies from 1st April 2007, and was mandatory from 1st April 2008. The aim of introducing combined code on Corporate Governance in Sri Lanka is to promote and enhance good governance in the listed companies in Sri Lanka and improve the investor confidence and also to promote economic development of the company. Corporate Governance and Dividend Policy Norazlan, et al. (2012) defined that on board structure, dividend per share and capital structure had a direct effect and it disclosed that increases in debt ratio, larger board size and the presence of duality role have significant negative effects on dividend payment. Meanwhile, the interaction between board structure and capital structure disclose that duality existence has weaken the negative effect of debt ratio on dividend payment while a large number of independent directors has strengthened the negative effect of debt ratio on dividend payment. These findings imply that having the same person as Chairman and the CEO or duality allows a person to have greater understanding and knowledge of firm. Maniagi, et al. (2013) carried out an investigation to find the relationship between corporate governance, dividend policy and performance of the banks listed on Nairobi Security Exchange. The shows that dividend yield for banks as a proxy of dividend policy is significant and positively correlated with  business risk and growth opportunities, also positively correlated with the  CEO duality but negative and significant to board independence as corporate governance proxy. The above detailed literature review highlights that the findings are vary as per the country, sample period and methodology used. When dividend policy is considered, some argue that it positively impacts on the firm\u2019s financial performance meanwhile some argue that it negatively impacts on the firm\u2019s financial performance. When theories of dividend policy are considered, they state many opinions. When it comes to the corporate governance concern, it also came with the same scenario according to the  studies of the pervious researches. The gap of literature is identified by going through the past studies arguments and it makes a sense to do this study to investigate the impact among  dividend policy, corporate governance and frim\u2019s financial performance.

Statistical model  Panel data regression procedure is used to investigate the dividend policy, corporate governance and firm performance. It examines individual firm effect, time effect, or both and these effects are either fixed or random. The pooled OLS model is run by neglecting the cross sections and time series nature of data assuming that all companies are same at all the time. Heterogeneity or individuality does not exist in pooled OLS model while it allows for fixed effect model. A fixed effects model is one of the statistical models which the parameters of the model are fixed. They have their own intercept values, but intercepts do not vary over the time. Random effect model has a common mean value for the intercept.  Both time effect and group effect are put through dummy variables into the model in the fixed effect model. For example, if only the group effect is entered in the model, then it should be included through the dummy variables d1, d2, \u2026., dn-1 if there are n number of groups. F test is used to check the appropriateness of the fixed effect model. If the p value of F test gives under significant level fixed effect model is appropriate. The model is given below.                       ", "29": " \n25  \nHowever, due to time effect, group effect and error, the variability is separated in the random effect model. Thus, it estimates variance components for groups, time or error. Therefore, differences are shown in error variances. Breush Pagan Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test is used to check whether the random effect model is appropriate or not. If the p value of LM test gives under significant level random effect model is appropriate. The model is as follows.                             The Durbin\u2013Wu\u2013Hausman test, also called as Hausman test is the specification test which is used to estimate the appropriate model among the random effect model and fixed effect model. If the hausman test rejects null hypothesis it implies that the fitted model is fixed effect model otherwise random effect model. 4. Results and Discussions This study investigates the effects of dividend policy, corporate governance and firm performance of the listed manufacturing companies in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). The data were analyzed using STATA. This section provides descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis and Diagnostic Tests which includes the results of Fisher (F)-test, VIF test, Unit root tests, Lagrange Multiplier (LM)-test and Hausman Specification test.

Board meetings and board independence denote significant negative relationships with ROE. However, board size has an insignificant positive relationship with ROE because the significant value is greater than 0.05. As well as dividend payout has a significant positive relationship with ROA at 0.01 significant level. There are insignificant negative relationships between earning per share, board meetings, board independence and ROA, since the significant levels are greater than 0.05. According to Pearson correlation values of board size and CEO duality express insignificant positive relationships with ROA. The dividend payout had a significant positive relationship with ROA while earning per share denotes a significant positive relationship with ROA. The board meetings, board independence, the CEO duality, board size do not show any significant association with ROA. The study applied three regression techniques such as pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect. All the variables of dividend policy, corporate governance and firm performance were tested for stationarity. Harris Tzavalis and Breitung unit-root tests results show that the dividend policy, corporate governance and firm performance were stationary at the level. Hence, it can be concluded that the data of the study do not have a unit root hence, they are stationary. Breitung unit-root test also produces enough evidence to reject null hypothesis (H0) while accepting alternative hypothesis (H1) as the p-value of the test 0.0646 (0.0646 < 0.1) and the data are stationary and the results show that the data are stationary.

The study contains a shorter period of 5 years which is treated as a micro panel. When applying the serial correlation test to a micro panel, it does not perform well as they put on to macro panels with long time series such as 20-30 periods of years (Baltagi, 2012). Robust standard error correcting is the answer to correct this issue in micro panels for the possible presence of Heteroscedasticity proposed by Baltagi (2012). Heteroscedasticity is existing in samples that random variables show differing variabilities than the other subsets of the variables. Therefore, in both regression models, both fixed and random effects are performed by using robust standard errors to do the estimation of the efficient regression coefficients. The existence of the fixed effects in residuals is tested through F statistics (Panel A and B of Table 4). The F- tests of all the two regressions performed rejecting the null hypothesis that all dummy parameters are jointly equal to zero and it may be concluded that the fixed firm effect model is better than the pooled OLS model. Hence, the fixed effect model is the better choice than the pooled OLS regression model. In the one- way fixed time effect models and the two- way models, no significant time impacts were found, and the analysis was conducted only on the one- way fixed firm and random effects models and the results are presented in Table 5.

Results and Discussion As per Table 5 the dividend payout, earning per share, board size, the CEO duality had a positive significant impact on both ROA and ROE hence, accept H1A, H1B, H1C and H1D. The board meetings in panel A negatively impacts on the ROE and accept H1E where as it does not significantly affect on ROA. The board independence does not significantly affect on firm performance thereby H1F is rejected. According to the specification, tests the fixed firm effect model is the best model for panel A and panel B. The dividend payout ratio is the most influential variable in determining dividend policy and firm performance which had a strong positive significant impact. The \"Bird in Hand\" theory defines that the shareholders always prefer higher dividend policy and signaling model proposes that the dividend as a sign of the firm\u2019s  yearly income, and it affects the management decisions in taking new projects. When dividend payout ratio increases it signals to the shareholders and investors that the company is performing well.  This study proves that earning per share has a significant positive effect on firm\u2019s performance which proves that if the firm\u2019s financial performance is high, shareholders\u2019 earning per share also goes high. Further, it signals to future and potential investors that an increase of profits of the firms will have a tendency of a positive impact on the dividend policy of firms.  Board size is an influential variable when determining the corporate governance on firm\u2019s performance which had a positive effect with the firm performance. This reveals that when board size increases firm performance will rise. When board size increases, many new ideas come into the firms, decision making process can be more accurate than earlier  and equity holders put their trust over the number of members in the board thereby creating a higher value for the firm. There is a positive association between the CEO duality and the firm\u2019s performance. When the CEO and chairman are two different persons it will lead to better management, decision making and no one can influence the management and the director board. There is a significant negative impact of board meetings on ROE which reveals that the higher the board meetings, higher will be the cost as many arrangements should be made before and after having a board meeting. The board meetings do not show any significant effect on ROA. Velnampy (2013) shows that the board meetings are not significantly correlated with ", "35": " \n31  ROA  in Sri Lankan manufacturing companies.The board independence does not reveal any significant effect on the firm performance. However, Bell, Greg, Curt Moore, and Igor Filatotchev (2012) and Rosenstein, Stuart, and Jeffrey Wyatt (1997) disclose that board independence shows a significant impact on ROE. They define that independent directors with a higher ratio can have positive impact on the performance. On the other hand, Rajendran (2012) finds that ROA has a positive correlation with board independence.  6. Conclusion The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of dividend policy, corporate governance and the firm performance in the listed manufacturing companies in Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) over the period from 2012 to 2016. Panel data approach was applied, and series of tests were conducted namely, diagnostics test of F test, Breusch-Pagen test, Hausman test and correlation analysis and panel data analysis. The correlation analysis reveals that the dividend payout ratio, earning per share and the CEO duality have significant positive relationships with ROE. However, board meetings and board independence show significant negative relationships while board size represents insignificant positive relationship with ROE. The dividend payout had a significant positive relationship with ROA whereas earning per share, board meetings and board independence reveal negative relationships with ROA. The fixed firm effect model shows that the dividend payout ratio, earning per share, board size, board meetings and the CEO duality except board independence have a significant impact on ROE. Among these significant variables, only board meetings find a negative impact on ROE while dividend payout, earning per share, board size and the CEO duality find positive impacts on ROE.  The study finds that dividend payout ratio, earning per share, board size, the CEO duality imply a positive significant impact on ROA. The results are useful for managers, employees, shareholders, potential and existing investors and academics. The future and potential investors who prefer to invest in the CSE can use this as a governance whether this sector matches with investors\u2019 preferences or not regarding dividend policy and corporate governance. Further, it can be a vital study for econometricians, policy makers, academics and other stakeholders for their policy making, decision making, related academic studies and so on. Also, this study is vital for many ", "36": " \n32  parties for strategic planning, to take decisions on managerial implications.  Future researchers can incorporate more variables on risk levels, economic conditions of firms and can consider other measures of firm performance such as both net profit and profit before income tax and interest. Also, further studies should focus on both the quantitative approach and qualitative approach by concerning more qualitative factors, especially the level of real power of relations in the director board, culture of firms, shareholder preference, situation of the company, future investors\u2019 preference and so on.

Department of Accountancy and Finance, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka  Abstract Advancements in information technology has created significant and reimbursed growth in the banking industry. With that, mobile banking services have been carried out with the concept of the \"bank on your hand.\" Thus, the main objective of this paper  is  to investigate the determinants of online mobile usage in people's bank, Avissawella branch.. This study was conducted on a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Plan Behavior. Questionnaires were distributed to the costomers who have used the bank's mobile banking service using the convenience sampling technique. A total  of 155 completed questionnaires were received. The  results shows that demographic factors, namely age, education, and occupation, are significantly impacted on Mobile banking usage. Subsequently, the variables, namely attitude, perceived usefulness, behavioral control, perceived ease of use, and subjective norm, are significant in this phenomenon. Finally, the study confirms that the attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control variables are lined with behavioral plan theory.  Keywords: Technology Acceptance Model, Theory of Plan Behavior, Mobile Banking, Mobile Banking Usage 1. Introduction  Developments in information technology have a massive effect on the banking sector, creating continually ever more flexible payment methods and user-friendly banking services. Since the 1980s, major technology-enhanced products and services, from automated teller machines (ATMs) to mobile banking, have become available everywhere 24/7 (Sangle & Awasthi, 2011). The rapid growth of mobile technology and the ever-growing ubiquity of mobile devices over the years have resulted in mobile banking ", "40": " \n36  evolving from a simple information delivery channel to a comprehensive banking transaction channel (Dandeniya, 2014). Banking and finance companies now pay attention to mobile banking, especially when maintaining customer relationships (Riivari, 2005). The ability to identify a customer\u2019s most pressing need at a given moment is one of the promising propositions of mobile banking, and the challenge nowise to deliver services according to consumers' perception of value and trust (KPMG International, 2009). Today, mobile banking applications are evolving as a new retail channel for banks. Mobile banking is a focal point of growth strategies for the banking and mobile carrier industries (Goswami and Raghavendran, 2009). Banks provide a combination of payments, banking, real-time two-way data transmission, and global access to financial information and services through mobile banking applications (Boyd & Jacob, 2007). It is now taken for granted that the mobile phone as a channel for service consumption offers massive potential in banking (Laukkanen and Lauronen, 2005). From all of the findings, we can see that mobile banking is also one of the fastest-growing banking practices nowadays. It is vital to extend this new banking feature to clients to maximize both clients and service providers (Qureshi, Zafar & Khan, 2008). In Sri Lankan context, banking services on the mobile channel were launched a few years ago. According to the Mobile Payment report in Sri Lanka: Market Demand Assessment (Lovelock, 2013), mobile services operators served 22.4 million subscribers. On the other hand, bank account ownership in Sri Lanka is 88.2%, and from that, the mobile banking usage of Sri Lanka is only 7.2%. So, the use of such services has not reached the desired level yet. It becomes more important to look for the factors operating on the consumer's side.  People's bank is a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka. The bank has 347 local branches and 387 Service Centers with 450+ own ATMs. The bank offers both Retail and Corporate Banking services, including Online Banking and Mobile Banking. Among those, all branches and networks, People's bank in Avissawella keeps rank at 34th by showing the highest profit margin. Through a personalized USSD information portal at Dialog, Mobitel, or Etisalat SIM inserted mobile phone, a People's Bank customer can also now access their account-related banking activities free of charge. Despite that, in the People's Bank, Avissawella branch, long queues can be seen in the counters daily for settling just a simple transaction like a ", "41": " \n37  balance inquiry. Most customers still question about their balance from the counters. It motivates to study the factors those impact to the use of mobile banking.  Although the bank has 80326 active saving accounts, only 2003 customers had got registered with the Mobile banking services. Information technology (IT) acceptance has been the subject of much research in the past two decades. Similarly, Mobile banking acceptance has received a particular attention in academic studies. Several research types on Mobile banking were carried out whereby the technology acceptance model has received more attention. Davis (1989) developed the Technology Acceptance Model, according to which \"users' adaptation of a computer system\" depends on their \"behavioral intention to use.\" TAM has been tested in many global studies by different authors. When considering the Sri Lankan context, enough research has not been carried out. Further, the People's bank has also not been  researched yet by using TAM and TPB. Observing such facts motivates to address the following research question; \u201cWhat are the factors influencing Mobile banking usage?\" The present study intends to accomplish the objective of the factors influencing Mobile banking usages such as Attitude, Perceived ease of use, Perceived Usefulness, Behavioral Control, and Subjective Norms on mobile banking usage. By identifying effective factors in using mobile banking, the bank can save costs, reach new segments of the population, achieve efficiency, and enhance the bank's reputation. It can provide a better customer service and satisfaction. Findings are useful to professionals in the banking sector, especially for developers of such information systems and the strategy makers, towards taking the banking services to a level commonly applicable in the developed world today. Banks can benefit with much lower operating costs by offering mobile banking services, which require less staff and fewer physical branches. Subsequently, the study is significant to branch to identify the weak points of the banking environment and improve performance. Further, this study's findings will help the banking sector to assess the impact of information technology and formulate appropriate strategies for building customer loyalty, enabling them to retain customers. 2. Literature Review Mobile banking or M-banking is the act of performing online financial transactions by using mobile telecommunication devices such as mobile phones or tablets (Forrester\u202f: Mobile Banking, n.d.) Users can access non-financial and financial services such as ", "42": " \n38  account management, balance inquiry, transference, bill payment, PIN change, and checkbook requests through mobile banking (Dahlberg et al., 2008; Luarn and Lin, 2005; Shaikh and Karjaluoto, 2015). The emergence and widespread of third-generation mobile communication technologies have laid a solid foundation for mobile commerce's rapid growth (Akturan & Tezcan, 2012). Ubiquity, flexibility, interactivity, and accessibility proved the possibility of mobile banking as a popular medium for consumers to make their banking transactions. Those are useful as a powerful marketing tool for bank retailers to interact with their consumers (Cheah et al., 2011; Schierholz et al., 2007). According to the findings, mobile banking is also one of the fastest-growing banking practices nowadays. It is vital to extend this new banking feature to clients to maximize both clients and service providers (Qureshi, Zafar & Khan, 2008). Mobile banking is seen to become a popular banking channel among consumers and the most typical application in mobile commerce (Liu et al., 2009) Technology Acceptance Model In 1989 Davis introduced the technology acceptance model (TAM), and it is used for modeling user acceptance of information systems. TAM's goal is to explain the determinants of computer acceptance (Davis et al., 1989). The TAM has been extensively used as the theoretical basis for many empirical studies of user technology acceptance and has significantly contributed to understanding users' acceptance of information systems  /information technology  (Taylor & Todd, 1995; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Davis and Venkatesh (1996), Gefen and Straub (2000), Al-Gahtani (2001) actual behavior in any system is determined by the perceived usefulness (PU) and the perceived ease of use (PEOU) relating to the attitude toward using that relates to intention and finally to behavior (Pikkarainen et al., 2004). According to the TAM, these two beliefs are primarily significant for computer acceptance (Pikkarainen et al., 2004). TAM proposed by Davis (1989) is an extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Aderonke & Charles, 2010). (TAM) is a perfect model which shows how users accept and use a technology (Jalal, Marzooq & Nabi, 2011). TAM has become popular among researchers because of its prudence approach and recent empirical support (Lallmahamood, 2007). Numerous empirical studies have found that TAM consistently explains a substantial proportion of the variance (typically about 40%) in usage behaviour and intentions (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). ", "43": " \n39  TAM was developed based on organizational settings (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). The management bore the cost of mandatory adaptation and adaptation of traditional technology by individual employees studied. According to (Sangle and Awasthi, 2011), mobile banking applications are for technology users and service consumers. The individuals themselves bear the cost of voluntary adaptation and usage (Kim et al., 2007). The disregard to assess the barriers to use the information system (in this case, the mobile banking application) and service consumer aspect of the individual take less likelihood of TAM reflecting mobile banking adaptation (Luarn and Lin, 2005).  Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was proposed by Ajzen (1985) as an extension of TRA (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) for situations where people do not have complete control over their behavior (Hernandez & Mazzon, 2007). The theory of planned behavior (TPB) assumes that behavior is determined by an intention to perform the behavior (Liao, et al. 1999). TPB adds a determinant to the behavioral intention and the attitude towards behavior constructs which is the perceived behavioral control. This construct reflects how people perceive their behavior's internal and external limitations (Hernandez & Mazzon, 2006). In more formal terms, it refers to how easy or difficult people believe it would be to perform certain behaviors (Ajzen, 1985) (as cited in Hernandez &Mazzon, 2006). In TPB, behavior itself is a function of both the behavioral intention and the perceived behavioral control. Behavioral intention, in turn, is influenced by the attitude towards behavior, the subjective norm, and the perceived behavioral control. The determinants of intention (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) are established by the structure of the underlying (attitudinal, normative, and control) beliefs (Hernandez & Mazzon, 2006) adaptation of an innovation. Perceived Ease of Use Perceived ease of use refers to \u201cthe degree to which the prospective user expects the target system to be free of effort\u201d (Davis et al., 1989, p. 985). Ease-of-use becomes a key acceptance driver of mobile applications with technical limitations (Venkatesh, 2000). Perceived ease of use has been used in many types of research to determine the probability of adopting an online system and user perceptions of system use (Alsajjan and Dennis, 2010; Teo et al., 1999) ", "44": " \n40  Perceived Usefulness People tend to use an application to the extent they believe it will aid their performance (Aderonke& Charles, 2010). Davis defined PU as \u201cthe degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance person\u2019s performance\u201d (as cited in Pakkarainen et al., 2004). The perception of usefulness is formed in interaction with other individuals and a system (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). Eriksson, Kerem & Nilson (2005) defined perceived usefulness as the subjective probability that using the technology would improve how  a user could complete a given task. ( Koenig-Lewis et al. (2010) found that compatibility, perceived usefulness, and risk are the signi\ufb01cant indicators for adopting mobile banking services. Attitude Attitude is defined as an individual\u2019s positive and negative feelings (evaluative effect) towards performing a target behavior (Fishbein&Ajzen, 1975). \"According to Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) shows people form beliefs about an object by associating it with various characteristics, qualities, and attributes. These beliefs acquire positive or negative attitudes toward that object depending on whether they associate it with positive or negative characteristics. These beliefs may be achieved by direct observation, obtaining information from outside sources, or generated through an inference process. Some can be beliefs persist, and others do not. Many existing studies in the context of e-business have found that an individual's attitude directly and significantly influences behavioral intention to use a particular e-business application (George, 2002; Gribbins et al., 2003; Moon and Kim, 2001). Attitude significantly affects intention to the usage of mobile banking (Puschel et al. 2010). Behavioral control Perceived behavioral control is defined as an individual's confidence that a person can perform the behavior (Ajzen, 2006). Ajzen (1987, 1991) and Ajzen and Madden (1986) developed the TRA further into TPB by adding a new determinant of behavioral intention: behavioral control, which is based on Bandura\u2019s concept of self-efficacy. Factors such as skills, abilities, time, and requisite information play a significant role in predicting and performing the behavior. Many studies in the Internet banking domain have supported the significant and positive effect of perceived behavioral control on an individual's behavioral intention (e.g., Al-Majali and Nik Mat, 2010; Jaruwachirathanakul and Fink, 2005; MdNor ", "45": " \n41  and Pearson, 2006).   Previous research regarding online technology adaptation suggests perceived behavioral control is an excellent predictor of usage intention (Choi and Geistfeld, 2004; George,2002; Klein and Ford, 2003). Subjective Norms Subjective norms are defined as  individual's perceptions of whether people who are essential to a person think that they should or should not perform the behavior in question (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). Subjective norm is determined by the total set of accessible normative beliefs considering essential referents' expectations (Ajzen, 1991). Subjective norms influence the behavioral choices of the Person (Doll and Ajzen,1992). Empirical research also suggests that subjective norms positively affect e-payment and internet banking adaptation (Gu et al., 2009; Kleijnen et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2020; Chan and Lu, 2004; Puschel et al., 2010). 3. Methodology Research methodology defines the systematic and scientific procedures used to arrive at the results and findings for a study against which knowledge claims are evaluated (Nachmias et al., 1996).  A methodology is therefore shaped by the perspective of the researcher\u2019s chooses to approach the study.   Operationalization of Demographic Variables In this study, both males and females were used as the group. The gender of the respondent is measured by using a single question of two possible answers, which are naturally segmented as \u201cMale\u201d and \u201cFemale.\" The respondent's age is categorized into four levels; below 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, above 51. Occupation of the respondents was categorized into three categories Student, self-employed, salaried. The respondents' level of education was categorized into five categories; No formal education, Up to Grade Eight, Passed GCE (O/L), Passed GCE (A/L), Completed the first degree, and Completed post-graduate degree and above.

Source: Developed by researchers  Research Design  The research design is a procedural plan which is used to answer the research questions accurately, objectively, economically, and with validity (Kumar, 1999). A descriptive cross-sectional research design was used in the study. The study was cross-sectional because the data was only collected on one occasion and therefore represented a snapshot of the respondents\u2019 responses at that specific point in time. The study is also descriptive since it focused on establishing the what, when, where, how, and why of consumer expectation from mobile services. Moreover, this can be classified as a single cross-sectional analysis, as the only a single sample has been  used. Study Setting The study is conducted in a natural (field) environment with minimum interference by the researcher with the normal flow of procedures related to the researching environment. Here, the researcher  collects data through a questionnaire, focus group, and in-depth interview from the respondents to understand what constitutes the primary concern when the customer uses mobile banking services and What factors can be identified as the guiding force for making better mobile CRM services in banking. Sample Design  According to (Sekaran 2009), the level of aggregation of the data collected during the subsequent data analysis stages can be defined as the study's unit of analysis. Therefore, the analysis unit specifies whether the information is collected about individuals, households, organizations, geographical areas, or subjects. This research unit of analysis is an individual who is buying saving products in the People's bank in Avissawella and from whom have no mobile banking service period of August 2017. The study population can ", "48": " \n44  be defined as the Consumers of the Avissawella people's bank that brought Avissawella people's bank's saving product. From whom did not have mobile banking service in August 2017 belong to all the age categories. Total 2003 customers are included in the population. Non-probability sampling was selected because it will be straightforward to find the relevant sample. It will be easy to access, minimum resources, and so on. Sekaran (2003), as cited in (Haque et al. 2015), suggested that the sample size should be more than 30 samples and should be less than 500 samples as the appropriate size of the sample size for most of the research projects. According to this rule, the sample size was fixed to 155 people belonging to all age categories. These people are buying saving products in the People's bank in Avissawella and had no mobile banking service in August 2017. The study collected the data from the people buying saving products in the People's bank in Avissawella. A structured questionnaire has been employed to collect primary data from the respondents. Data were collected from sample elements by distributing the questionnaire through internet questionnaire forms and email and filling the hard copies.  4. Analysis and Discussion  Reliability Estimate Cronbach\u2019s Alpha value (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994) is calculated to test the instrument's internal consistency reliability. Reliability coefficient as Cronbach\u2019s Alpha coefficient shows the average correlation among items that include under a variable. The result of the reliability analysis is shown in Table 2.  Since all the values are greater than 0.7, the questionnaire can be considered a reliable one.  Table 1: Test of reliability Variable Cronbach\u2019s Alpha Value Attitude .951 Perceived ease of use .970 Perceived usefulness .898 Behavioral control .846 Subjective norm .862 Mobile banking adaptation .864    ", "49": "45  Validity Estimate In order to test the external validity of the measures, the KMO test was used. To meet the validity of the scales, the KMO Test value should be greater than 0.5 (Field, 2009) Table 2: Test of Validity Variable No of Item KMO Attitude 4 .868 Perceived ease of use 3 .780 Perceived usefulness 3 .710 Behavioral control 3 .681 Subjective norm 3 .661 Mobile banking adaptation 3 .654 The results show that the KMO measure of all variable is grater than 0 .5.  It indicates the adequacy of the sample size to generalize the findings to the population.  Interpreting the results from Pearson Chi-Square Tests The results generated from Pearson Chi-Square Tests are shown in Table 3. It shows a significant association between Mobile banking usage and Age, Occupation, Education, Attitudes, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, Behavioral Control, and Subjective Norms except for Gender.

It is similar to the finding of (Aboelmaged and Gebba, 2013). In consistent with finding of Kazi and Mannan (2013) and Makanyeza (2017),  the study finds that Perceived Usefulness\u2019 significantly affects the mobile banking usage in the People\u2019s Bank Avissawella branch. This study proved that Behavioral control significantly affects on the mobile banking usage in the People\u2019s Bank, Avissawella branch. It is similar to the study conducted by (Aboelmaged and Gebba, 2013). This study found that perceived ease of use significantly affects the  mobile banking usage in the People\u2019s Bank, Avissawella branch.  It is against  (Kazi and Mannan,2013). Also, this study shows that Subjective norms significantly affects the mobile banking usage in the People\u2019s Bank, Avissawella branch. The findings of this study are dissimilar to the study conducted by (Aboelmaged and Gebba, 2013).  5. Conclusion The primary objective of this study is to investigate the factors that affect usage of mobile banking based on technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior. The result of the analysis conveys a message that demographic factors, such as Age, Education, and Occupation are significantly influenced on the Mobile banking usage but Gender is not impact on this phenomenon.  In addition, it gives a message that Attitudes, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, Behavioral Control and, Subjective Norms significantly affect on the mobile banking services in this bank.  The study results imply that the existing system of the People\u2019s Bank-Avissawella should be developed in several steps. The bank can promote mobile banking applications through the Above the Line (ATL) and Below the Line (BTL), to change people\u2019s attitudes. The  bank staff of Avissawella are not actively engaged in promoting mobile banking services to their customers.. Staff is mostly busy with the day-to-day schedules. So, the customers should be informed about mobile banking, specially the customers of the young age category. Mobile banking applications should be recommended to be  attached to the new saving account with an open mandate. Attractive leaflets should be prepared including the benefits of mobile banking specially showing \u201ccost free\u201d and how it enhances their life performances should be  known by the customer. Some customers do not like to change their mobile service provider. They consider it the most useful one. Therefore, not only limited mobile banking application of ", "51": " \n47  the Mobitel, Dialog and Etisalat service providers but also the bank should capture all other mobile service providers.

Department of Accountancy & Finance, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka aagkumara@gmail.com* Abstract The plastic and polythene industry in Sri Lanka is running with many  challenges due to the negative natural environmental impact. Under the prevailing direct and indirect influences towards the industry, it has to gain financial returns by adjusting towards a sustainable existence. This study investigates the determinants of the financial performance of Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt.) Limited, which is a leading polythene manufacturing company in Sri Lanka. The study focused on three specific objectives; (i) explore the behaviour of the firm-specific variables, (ii) identify the association between variables and (iii) rank the significant variables in each good model. The study employed the deductive approach using the secondary data from May 2012 to May 2017 monthly. Multiple regression model explored the best model out of the result of three tested models. Out of two dependent variables, Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), ROA have given significant results on three models. However, the selected model defines the results of the study. Results indicate that liquidity, leverage, management efficiency and interest expense are significant on ROA. Among the selected determinants, firm-specific factors highly influence the company\u2019s financial performance rather than the macro-economic factors. Empirical findings of this study may be helpful for policymakers and senior management of the Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt.) Limited to craft their strategic decisions highlighting the firm-specific determinists for the best performance.   Keywords: Plastic Industry, Financial Performance, Firm-Specific Variables, Macro-economic Variables.    ", "57": " \n53  1. Introduction Manufacturing sector companies play a vital role in contributing to the economic growth. In the Sri Lankan context, private manufacturing firms dominate the market over the public sector among different manufacturing sectors. To achieve a higher level of business performance sustainably, they have to carry out their operations smoothly with continuous solid financial performance. Since track on the firms' performances indicates how the business runs healthy and manages the resources to gain competitive advantages (Iswatia & Anshoria, 2007). Financial performance has been widely used as an indicator for business performance (Ezzemel, 1992; Ezzemel & Hart, 1989; Rappaport, 1986). Proper performance measurement derives valuable information to efficiently utilize the funds and other assets efficiently and effectively towards the company's best decisions. When good financial performance rewards and motives, their stakeholders ultimately maximize the nation's wealth; on the other hand, weak financial performance can lead to firm failure and inside a crisis, which negatively affects economic growth. However, the financial performance of a firm is influenced by external and internal factors. Macro-economic and firm-specifics are the two different influences that affect a firm's financial performance externally and internally. Most studies found that when firm-specific factors influence the management and director board (Hansen and Wernerfelt, 1989), such studies rarely have focused on the macro-economic impact.   Polythene Industry and Primex Lanka (Pvt.) Limited Among the manufacturing sector, polythene and plastic-based manufacturing sector based on rubber and plastics, a vital production segment in Sri Lanka. Central Bank of Sri Lanka (2016) highlights the significant contribution identifying among the top ten income generation areas in Sri Lanka. In recent years, the polythene and plastic industry is influenced by the diverse challenges due to mainly the evidence of environmental pollution. Jayasekara (2017) highlighted that according to the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, the production of polythene or any polythene product of 20 microns or below in thickness for in-country use and the sale is prohibited in Sri Lanka from 01 February 2016. Though producing polythene and plastic has become a criticized industry ", "58": " \n54  in recent times, polythene and plastic manufacturing companies are performing their businesses with a considerable number of small-scale enterprises in Sri Lanka.  Primex Lanka Plastic is a Private Limited company that has undertaken a range of polythene products among the polythene and plastic industry in Sri Lanka. The company mainly focuses on the international market supplying 65% of the production and raw materials imported from the oil-producing countries. Since the local and international scenarios influence the company's financial performances, however, today, they have become the second runners of their market. However, the company's financial performances have shown a downward trend with huge unstable fluctuations in recent years, as shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1: Behavior of Return on Asset ratio and Return on Equity Ratio of the Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt.) Limited Year 2012/2013 2013/2014 2014/2015 2015/2016 2016/2017 ROA 80.12% 25.45% 24.48% 20.79% 13.66% ROE 93.29% 60.15% 52.99% 48.38% 33.72% Source: Audited Accounts of Primex Lanka (Pvt.) Limited (2012-2017) Though the firm performs in a market gaining higher market share, the symptoms of unpredicted financial performance behaviour have shown unexplored scenarios and relationships of internal and external sources influences. However, few studies investigating the relationship considering both macro and firm-specific factors on financial performance are very scarce in the manufacturing sector since the evidence and reasons for the company issue are also limited. Especially, the impact of different constraints devised on the polythene and plastic industry in Sri Lanka is also an unexplored area among researchers. Since the researcher aims to find the solutions on the behaviour of the firm-specific factors, the impact of both macro and internal environment on financial performance in the Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt.) Limited. This would bring an idea of what would be the financial gain from the polythene productions even among these market conditions in Sri Lanka. Because producing polythene is still a criticized arena among the general society, it will also generate additional risk to the company that other manufacturing sector companies do not face.

Literature Review The literature review, theoretical review and empirical review present different theories and concepts which give the light for this study to build up the flow on the determinants and influencing variables.  2.1 Theoretical Review Performance can simply be defined as a result of an activity or action or process of performing a task or function. Company performance is essential to manage resources to gain a competitive advantage (Iswatia & Anshoria, 2007). Moreover, Walker (2001) investigated the three main dimensions to measure the performance: the company\u2019s productivity, profitability, and earning with its costs and market premium. However, most of the studies described the firm performance based on the financial performance, and it has been widely used as an indicator for business performance (Ezzemel, 1992; Ezzemel & Hart, 1989; Rappaport, 1986). According to Havnes and Senneseth (2001), financial performance can express growth of sales, turnover, employment, or stock prices. Financial performance is measured through financial statements. There are various financial measures calculated based on financial statements data and return on asset, return on sales and equity, etc. Though there are different methods and criteria available to measure the performance, it should include multiple criteria analysis. This multi-dimensional view of performance suggests that additional models or patterns of relationship between business performance and its determinants will emerge to establish various relationships between variables in the established models (Ostroff and Schmidt, 1993). Managing the association between firm\u2019s short-term assets and short-term liabilities can be identified as working capital management (Guthmann & Dougall, 1948). Further, balancing liquidity and profitability in an optimal way for trading and manufacturing organizations is critical if current assets are significant compared to the total assets. Though the firm is profitable, if trade receivable amounts are tied up, the firm has to borrow credit to finance inventory and then it will cause to increase the interest expense. Profitability and liquidity should be carefully managed to confirm the firm's going concern (Thuvarakan, 2013). Scholars found that because of high inventory days, high cash receivable days, and long cash operating cycles, most businesses fail due to inefficient management of working capital items (Rafuse, 1996).  ", "60": " \n56  Management can be defined as planning, organizing, leading, and controlling organizational resources efficiently and effectively to achieve the organizational goals. The lifestyle model explains that management efficiency and learning are the key factors for firm performance and growth (Jovanovic, 1982). Representing the management efficiency through the financial ratios is somewhat a complex scenario. The performance of management is often expressed qualitatively, including evaluation of management systems, control systems, quality of the staff and others; some of the financial ratios act as proxies for management efficiency (Ongore & Kusa, 2013).  The theory related to the optimal capital structure is known as the \u201cirrelevance theorem\u201d. It suggested that, in perfect capital markets, capital structure choice does not affect a firm\u2019s market value. Absence of the corporate taxes, brokerage and symmetrical information imply that the investors and managers have the same information (Modigliani & Miller, 1958). Due perfect capital market is not a reality; a new idea brought by Modigliani and Miller (1963) as a tax benefit of the debt elaborating use of debt capital  causes a minimizing of the firm\u2019s cost of capital and maximizing its profitability. It assumed that a firm\u2019s value is maximized when it employs more of debt in its capital structure than equity. Then  the other three capital structure theories have been developed, such as the trade-off theory (Bradley, Jarrell & Kim 1984), agency cost theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976) and pecking order theory (Myers and Majluf, 1984).  2.2 Legal Background of the Polythene and Plastic Industry in Sri Lanka According to the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1466/5 issued under section 23W of the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, the manufacture of polythene or any polythene product of 20 microns or below in thickness for in-country use and the sale is prohibited in Sri Lanka from 01 February 2016 (Daily Mirror, 2016). Due to this act, polythene and plastic manufacturers might limit their production, which is a political influence on the industry. 2.3 Empirical Review  There are plenty of studies in which there are many internal determinants of firm performance, out of which this capital structure, working capital management, managerial efficiency, and interest expense are vital. Gill, Biger, & Mathur (2011) seek to extend Abor\u2019s (2005) findings that positive relationship between short-term debt to total assets ", "61": " \n57  and ROA, long-term debt to total assets and ROA, and between total debt to total assets and ROA in the manufacturing industry in the study of American manufacturing and service firms during 2005 to 2007. Further, Roden and Lewellen (1995) discovered a positive relationship between profitability and capital structure in the study of US firms during 1981-1990. However, Salim and Yadav (2012) found that ROA, ROE and earning per share (EPS) have a negative relationship with short-term debt, long-term debt and total debt in the study done for Malaysia during 1995-2011. Further, Obert and Olawale (2010) suggested that debt had a negative impact on the profitability of small manufacturing firms in the study of manufacturing firms in Zimbabwe.  Similarly, Thuvarakant (2013) found that working capital components by receivable days, payable days, inventory days, cash conversion cycle, and profitability showed no significant relationship between the manufacturing industries in the United States from 2007 to 2011. There was a significant positive relationship between firm profitability and the current ratio in Ukrainian firms (Ankintoye, 2000). Further, there was a significant relationship between the company's working capital management and profitability criteria in Iran (Pouraghajan & Emamgholipourarchi, 2012).  Quality of management is necessary for the success of every company. However, Almajali, Alamro and Soub (2012) found that leverage, liquidity, size, and management efficiency positively affected the financial performance in Jordanian companies during 2002-2007. Agiomirgianakis, Voulgaris and Papadogonas (2006) explored that size, age, exports, debt structure, investment in fixed assets, assets' profitability, and sales contribute significantly to firm profitability and employment growth in Greek manufacturing firms from 1995 to 1999. Further, Ongore and Kusa (2013) found that capital adequacy and management efficiency positively affect the performance while asset quality negatively affected the performance in Kenya commercial banks from 2001 to 2010.  Then, Odalo (2015) found a significant positive relationship between interest coverage ratio and financial performance, while size, sales growth, operating cost efficiency, liquidity and interest rate positively impacts on the financial performance. But, ownership structure negatively impacts the financial performance in the Nairobi securities exchange. Further, Bhunia and Khan (2011) found a significant positive relationship between interest coverage ratio with return on assets in Indian private sector steel companies.  ", "62": " \n58  Concerning macro-economic variables, Baggs, Beaulieu, and Fung (2007) found that the firm\u2019s probability of survival, sales and entry are negatively associated with appreciations in the Canadian dollar study for plastic producing companies during 1986 to 1997. However, in the Turkey context, Demir (2009) suggested that the real exchange rate uncertainty had a statistically insignificant positive coefficient with the profitability in the real sector.  Demir (2007) found that the real interest rates and capital flow volatility significantly affected the manufacturing firm profitability in Turkey manufacturing firms from 1993 to 2003. Moreover, Bekeris (2012) found that most of the selected macro-economic indicators such as inflation, average wages, oil price, the number of enterprises, and the monetary bases were not statistically significant with the corporate profitability in Lithuania and the European Union SME from 2000 to 2010. Further, Odalo (2015) found that interest rate significantly positively impacts the firm performance in the Kenyan context.  However, Gunaya, et al. (2005) explored that the profit margins positively impacted price inflation and real wage costs in Turkish manufacturing firms from 1980 to 1986. Then, Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2003) found that the increase of consumption volatility and uncertainty of vital macro prices and capital flows in developing countries in the post financial liberalization era directly impacted the firm profitability. Further, Demir (2009) found that increasing macro-economic uncertainty and volatility significantly negatively affected Turkey\u2019s firms\u2019 profitability from 1993 to 2003. However, Bekeris (2012) explained that inflation does not impact corporate profitability.  Shah (1992) suggested significant positive relationships with public infrastructure and profitability and industrial production and profitability among Mexican manufacturing industries from 1970 to 1987. Further, Sayilgan and Yildirim (2009) found that the consumer price index and first difference of ratio of off-balance-sheet transactions to total assets negatively affect the profitability. The first differences of industrial production index, the ratio of budget balance to industrial production index and the ratio of equity to total assets affect profitability indicators positively in Turkey from 2002 to 2007.  According to Sri Lankan evidence, Sivathaasan et al. (2013) suggested that capital structure and non-debt tax shield significantly impact profitability. The remaining working capital, growth rate, and firm size have no significant effects on manufacturing companies' profitability from 2008 to 2012. Then, Niresh (2012) found no significant relationship ", "63": " \n59  between liquidity and profitability among the listed manufacturing firms\u2019 period from 2007 to 2011. However, Samarakoon (1999) examined the determinants of leverage in a cross-section of quoted companies and the result found that profitability is reliably negatively correlated to leverage. Further, Pratheepan (2014) found that size shows a positive relationship with the profitability, whereas tangibility shows a negative relationship with the profitability for selected listed manufacturing companies from 2003 to 2012.  3. Methodology As this study focuses on the financial performance of Primex Lanka Limited, the sample consists only of the firm. The data has been gathered on the firm's profitability, macro-economic and firm\u2019s specific variables, which are considered from the literature on production firms.  However, data are included for 61 months over the years from May 2012 to May 2017 of the company's financial performances. However, data are sourced from the Annual reports of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan Economic and Census Department\u2019s monthly reports, and the company\u2019s management accounts. In addition to that, to identify the political influence, data are obtained from Sri Lankan public newspapers reports and the previous articles regarding polythene and plastic, which the Sri Lankan Parliament passed. Then, data on relevant variables representing return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) for firm\u2019s profitability, current ratio (CR), cash conversion cycle (CCC), debt ratio (DA), debt to equity ratio (DE), long term debt to equity ratio (LDE), Operating profit to income ratio (ME), Interest Coverage Ratio (IC) for firm\u2019s specific variables and exchange rate (EX), oil price (OI), interest rate (IR), inflation (IN), factor industrial production index (FIPI), political influences (PI) are for the macro-economic variables.  The study explores the impact of firm-specific and macro-economic variables on financial performances with two models for ROA and ROE. Since the data are a time series pattern for 61 months for each variable relating to one entity, a multiple linear regression procedure is applied. Using the SPSS computer software, multicollinearity among the variables was tested using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).  The study examines the impact of the firm-specific and macro-economic variables on the financial performance of Primex Lanka Limited, highlighting the polythene and plastic industry. In addition to the primary analysis, descriptive statistics and correlation ", "64": "60  coefficient were utilized to identify the behaviour of the variables and its association among the variables based on previous studies.

However, the return has deviated by 1.36% and 3.89% for ROA and ROE, respectively. It showed a minimum return of -0.72% and a maximum return of 6.22% for ROA. Further, a maximum return of 19.90% and minimum return of -1.80% is indicated for ROE. Then results of CCC suggests the firm\u2019s liquidity based on pay for and generate cash from sales of its inventory. It shows that an average of 12 days has taken on ", "66": " \n62  CCC while it has varied by 16 days. However, the payment and receivable on inventory recorded a maximum of 58 days. Then the company's average current ratio (CR) stood at 1.17 which meant that the ability to pay short-term obligations. Two or more current ratios are recommended for a manufacturing company by professionals. However, it can be reduced due to lower buffer stock towards lower working capital. However, the times of current assets on current liabilities has varied by 0.20 times while it has taken a minimum of 0.77 times to a maximum of 1.61 times. Then, DA, DE, and LDE represent the nature of the company\u2019s average capital structure stood at 58%, 142%, and 16%, respectively. The total debt ratio indicates the portion of total assets financed by firm creditors. The debt used to generate the profit has varied by 4.48% while recording its minimum and maximum at 52.60% and 78.76%. DE meant that the portion of debt relating to the equity of a firm.

Further, it has varied by 37.91%, recording minimum and maximum values of 110.97% and 370.98%, respectively. Next, LDE indicates its long-term Debt against the equity capital. However, the result indicates that LDE has varied by 18.69%. Then, the long-term Debt to equity has taken a minimum of 0.41% and a maximum of 58.39% in particular months. However, the capital structure ratios volatility is not particularly high since variability is below the respective averages in the two proxies. But, the long-term debt-equity ratio has a high volatility as the standard deviation is above its average. Then ME represents the efficiency of the management towards better financial performance. However, it is tracked as the higher the operating profits to total income (revenue), the more efficient management is in operational efficiency and income generation. Results indicate that the average of ME was 8.59% dispersed during the months by 5.83%. Then, the minimum and maximum ME stood at -15.20% and 17.48%. Results indicate that management has changed over time without sustainable operation among the firm. Finally, interest expenses representing interest coverage ratio recoded as 9.3 times which meant as 9.3 times, the company can  pay their interest expense from profit before interest and taxes. However, it has varied by 8.6 times, taking the minimum and maximum -1.7 and 52.05 times, respectively.    ", "67": " \n63  Then, the results of the macro-economic variable indicate its behaviour. EX represents the average rupee value for one American dollar as the exchange rate. However, the average EX is recoded as Rs. 135.987 during the 61 months. However, EX has varied by Rs.7.891 while fluctuated to a minimum of Rs 126.304 and a maximum of Rs. 152.030. However, the changes of the EX significantly impact the firm's profitability due to its production based on imported raw materials. Then, the oil price (OI) highlights its importance, as the raw materials are by-products of the crude oil. However, the average crude oil drum rupee stood at Rs.10,076.91, while the minimum and maximum values were Rs. 4,306.680 and Rs. 14,410.32, respectively. But, the OI has varied during the period by Rs. 3,365.736. The three-month Treasury bill rates represent the interest rate (IR) which has recorded the average rate of 8.10% while recording minimum and maximum of 5.7 % and 11.97%. However, the interest rate has deviated by 1.694%, showing a somewhat constant rate. Colombo Consumer Price Index represents inflation, and it lay down the range between 162.1 and 195.2. However, the average index was 179.92 for a particular month but varied by 8.262. However, Factory Industrial Production Index (FIPI) represents the nature of the rubber and plastic sector. The minimum and maximum FIPI lay between 94.3 and 152.4 while the average of 129.77. However, the dispersion of the index during the period was at 14.358. It means the average of this index in a particular month can vary on both sides by 14.358. However, it measures the short-term changes in the volume of industrial production from the manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka. 4.2 Results of the Correlation among the Variables The following table results indicate the association among the firms-specific and macro-economic variables between the financial performance proxies of ROA and ROE.  Table 3: Correlation Coefficient among Variables Variables ROA ROE CCC 0.028   (0.832) 0.176   (0.175) CR 0.255* (0.048) 0.216   (0.094) DA -0.266* (0.039) -0.060   (0.644) DE -0.251   (0.051) -0.037   (0.778) LDE -0.266* (0.038) -0.303* (0.018) ME 0.561* (0.000) 0.457* (0.000) IC 0.694* (0.000) 0.700* (0.000) EX -0.341* (0.007) -0.294* (0.022) lnOI -0.335* (0.008) -0.287* (0.025) ", "68": " \n64  IN 0.114   (0.383) 0.285* (0.026) CCPI -0.479* (0.000) -0.567* (0.000) FIPI -0.136   (0.296) -0.309* (0.015) PI -0.418* (0.001) -0.415* (0.001) Note: Parenthesis are p-value in 5% significant level Initially, a positive correlation between ROA and CR of the firm indicates that meeting the short-term obligations has improved the return generated from the company's existing assets (r = 0.255, p =0.048). However, the association between firms\u2019 liquidity and ability to generate returns from their equity is insignificant. Moreover, CR has explained the firms\u2019 ROA only by 6.5% (0.2552) during the period. Existing results on the negative correlation between DA and ROA indicates that the higher the total assets financed by creditors, the lower the return earned from assets. According to the results, a negative correlation between LDE between ROA and ROE says that higher the long-term debt out of company equity has reduced the return earned on assets of the company (r = -0.266, p = 0.038). In contrast, it has reduced the ROE (r = -0.303, p = 0.018). However, it evidenced that long term and short-term debt of the company has gone up, which ultimately caused to reduce the return of the company.  Then, the positive association between ME and ROA, ROE indicates that higher operating profits generated through changes taken placed through management changes has improved the return generated on assets (r = 0.561, p = 0.000) and the company's equity (r = 0.457, r = 0.000). Therefore, the improvement of ROA is explained by the ME by 31.4% (0.5612). The improvement of ROE has explained the ME by 20.8% (0.4572). Then there is a positive correlation between IC and ROA, ROE, respectively. According to the results, more the interest pays out of company profit before interest and tax, improve the return on assets (r = 0.694, p = 0.000) and the impact of interest expenses explained the return on assets by 48% (0.6942). Results further say that more interest pays out of its profits has improved the return generated from equity (r = 0.700, p = 0.000). However, ROE is also explained by the interest income by 49% during the period (0.7002). Again, the results highlight that long-term debts included in the firms\u2019 operations have improved their return.  When considering the macro-economic variables, the negative correlation between EX and ROA, ROE indicates that the Sri Lankan rupees paid against US dollars has discouraged the return generated from company assets (r = -0.341, p = 0.007) and return generated from the company equity (r = -0.294, p = 0.022) during previous months. The exchange rate has ", "69": " \n65  explained the ROA by 15% (-0.3912) and ROE by 8.6% (-0.2942), respectively, evidencing the impact of exchange rate company return due to materials being solely imported. Furthermore, the negative correlation between lnOI and ROA and ROE highlight that when prices on a barrel of crude oils go up, firms\u2019 ROA (r = -0.335, p = 0.008) and ROE (r = -0.287, p = 0.025) has gone down. The reason behind that is that the oil price increment may also affect the increment of their basic raw material prices because their basic raw materials are the by-product of the petroleum extraction process. Thus, it will cause to increase in their production cost. The positive correlation between IR and ROA indicates that more the interest rate on three months treasury bills has gone up, return of the company from equity has also improved (r = 0.285, p = 0.026). The negative correlation between CCPI and ROA, ROE respectively indicates that increment of the country's inflation rate has discouraged the ROA (r = -0.479, p = 0.000) and ROE (r = -0.567, r = 0.000). Further, it depicts that the inflation rate has explained the ROA by 22.9% (-0.4792) and ROE by 32.1% (-0.5672), respectively. However, the negative correlation between FIPI and ROE indicates that changes in the volume of industrial production from the manufacturing sector have decreased the ROE of the firm (r = -0.309, p = 0.015). Finally, the negative correlation between PI and ROA, ROE respectively indicate that more political decisions regarding the polythene industry in Sri Lanka have reduced the ROA (r = -0.418, p = 0.001) and ROE (r = -0.415, p = 0.001). Therefore, it is clear that government decisions in respect to the polythene industry were influenced negatively.   4.3 Results of the Multiple Linear Regression After meeting the linearity and multivariate normality assumptions, the variance inflation factor (VIF) investigated the multicollinearity among the variables. Initially, two models were developed, including all the variables and variables taken VIF value more than ten is excluded from the exsisting model  of multicollinearity among the variables. However, VIF values of 12.439, 11.942, 7,387.7, 7,105.9 and 16.375 recorded for debt ratio (DA), debt to equity ratio (DE), the exchange rate (EX), oil price (OI) and inflation (CCPI) were excluded, respectively. Then, the two models are tested with another assumption of whether residuals are independent of each other called autocorrelation. Durbin-Watson statistics indicate an autocorrelation problem in the model of ROE, recording the statistics of 0.917 as in Table 4. ", "70": "66  Further progression of the analysis model of ROA is considered. However, the results of the model ROA indicates that return on assets is explained by the firm-specific factors and macro-economic factors by 64.2%. In contrast, the overall model is significant according to the ANOVA results (0.000).  Table 4: Regression results of the ROA and ROE Variables ROA ROE Unstandard.

Moreover, in three models, ROA is explained by the predictors by 70.1%, 70.1% and 70.6%, respectively. However, the autocorrelation result of the Durbin-Watson statistic indicates 2.4 compared to other slightly lower models. Further, the adjusted R2 of the third model of ROA indicates a somewhat higher figure of 64.8% compared to other of 64.1%, which means that by including one variable to model, the third model can secure its explained power than the other. The model is discussed as follows. Results indicate that though there is a significant influence by cash conversion cycle (CCC), improvement in ROA is very low. Since, when one-unit change in CCC, has improved the ROA by 0% (r = 0.000, p = 0.001). Scholars found a negative relationship between CCC and firm performance (Zariyawati et al., 2009; Nobanee et al., 2011), but the result of positive relationships tally with the findings of Gill et al. (2010) and Sharma and Kumar (2010) who suggested a significant positive relationship between cash conversion cycle and firm performance.  ", "72": " \n68  Then results indicate that one unit change in the current ratio (CR) has improved the ROA by 2% (r = 0.020, p = 0.032) while other predictors in the model are constant. Further, Ankintoye (2000) found a significant positive relationship between the current ratio and firm performance.   Debt ratio (DA) is a proxy used to represent the capital structure and found that one unit change in DR has decreased the ROA 15.1% (r = -0.151, p = 0.005) while other predictors in the model are constant. This result is also consistent with pecking order theory which suggested a negative relationship between leverage and firm performance. Further, Salim and Yadav (2012), Shubita and Alsawalhah (2012) revealed some similar findings with this study. However, the above finding is inconsistent with the capital structure theory by Modigliani and Miller (1963).  Whether the coefficient of LDE shows a positive relationship with firm performance in regression analysis is insignificant for all of the above models.   Then results denote that when one unit changes in management efficiency (ME), it has improved the ROA by 10.1% (r = 0.101, p = 0.003) while other predictors in the model are constant. If a firm can increase the efficiency of their management, it directly may impact control their costs and generate economies for the company. Hence, finally, this overall process may positively impact their financial performance. That is consistent with the lifestyle model (Jovanovic, 1982), which suggest a positive relationship between management efficiency and firm performance. Agiomirgianakis et al. (2006), Almajali et al. (2012), and Ongore and Kusa (2013) found a significant positive relationship between the above variables.  The interest coverage ratio is the proxy that is used to represent the interest expense. Results indicate that when one unit change in IC has improved the ROA by 0.2% (r = 0.002, p = 0.003) while other predictors in the model are constant. A higher interest coverage ratio means a company can easily cover their interest expense from their profit. If they have sound financial performance, they can easily cover the interest expense. This result agrees with developing countries like Bhunia, et al. (2011) in the Indian context. Odalo (2015), in the Kenyan context, found a significant positive relationship between interest coverage ratio and firm performance.     ", "73": " \n69  Further, the three-month Treasury bill rate is the only macro-economic factor that shows the significant relationship with the financial performance of Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt) Limited. Results show a significant positive relationship between interest rate and financial performance. When it was investigated whether this result is inconsistent with Amarjit, G. et al. (2010) and Demir (2007), Odalo (2015) found that interest rate showed a asignificant positive impacts on firm financial performance. According to the company view, they borrow loans continuously to invest whether the interest rate is high. Their investment returns are more than the cost of the loans. Hence this may be a possible reason for showing a positive relationship between interest rates and firm performance.   Most of the selected macro-economic variables, CCPI, FIPI and PI, do not indicate significant relationships with the financial performance of Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt) Limited. Bekeris (2012) explained that most macro-economic variables like oil price and inflation do not impact corporate profitability. 5. Conclusion, Implication and Suggestions The result suggested that liquidity, leverage, management efficiency, interest expenses and interest rate are the most important determinants of the financial performance of Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt) Limited. However, the cash conversion cycle and current ratio have a significant positive impact on ROA through liquidity. Leverage represented by debt ratio shows a significant negative relationship with ROA. Management efficiency has significantly impacted ROA to improve. Then, interest coverage is also a significant positive impact on ROA. Among all the selected macro-economic variables, the Treasury bill interest rate is the only significant macro-economic variable that positively impacts ROA in the two models. However, in other models, the Treasury bill interest rate is not a significant variable in the Primex Lanka Plastic (Pvt) Limited. Results indicate the behaviour of determinants against the profitability in the plastic and polythene industry.  In recommendations, producing polythene and plastic government must bring rules and regulations for a win-win situation for the entrepreneurs and the general public. In future studies, areas concerning the quality of the products, innovations, quality of the supply chain, goodwill of the company, social barriers, etc., can be considered to increase the awareness of both management and regulatory bodies.

The population of this study was registered internet banking customers of the People\u2019s Bank Rathnapura branch. A sample of 130 customers was used to gather data on five selected Demographic Characteristics (Age, Gender, Occupation, Education, and Marital Status) and other three variables (Perceived ease of use, Perceived usefulness and Perceived security). Demographic Characteristics were analyzed using chi-square analysis, and other variables were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The chi-square analysis proved that there are significant relationships between age and marital status on adaptation of Internet banking services. Regression analysis emphasized that  perceived ease of use; perceived usefulness and perceived security have significant impacts on the customer adaptation of Internet banking services in People\u2019s bank Rathnapura branch. Policymakers are advised to monitor customer attitudes (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived security) towards the internet banking system regularly. .

Background of the Study The banking sector in Sri Lanka plays a vital role in the financial sector. In  the conventional banking system, customers prefer carrying out the banking services by physically visiting the bank and all the banking transactions take place manually. Manual transactions are time consuming and cost to both customers as well as the bank. And also, there are some problems such as limited working hours and personalized services.  In traditional banking, a greater amount of capital investment is required to maintain the in-house operating system. Therefore, the operating cost of traditional banks is relatively high compared to internet banking because internet banking uses the internet as the medium, which is deemed the cheapest distribution channel (Polasik & Wisniewski, 2008). In addition, traditional banks allocate capital for labor and infrastructure costs. On the other hand, internet banking acquires savings that allows them to offer higher interest rates and lower lending rates and service charges.  Recently, the trend for traditional banks is to encourage their customers to do their banking online.  Internet banking is catching the banking industry by doing banking activities from web-based online systems. In electronic banking, customers take banking transactions electronically. E-banking may include ATMs, wire transfers, telephone banking, electronic funds transfers and debit cards (Mobarek, 2007). Customers do not want to physically access the bank and customer gets the bank account ID, password and can check account, pay bills and print receipt through personal computers connected with internet.  Sri Lankans are now enjoying internet banking services, where it was first introduced in Sri Lanka in March 1999 (Jayamaha, 2008). Internet Banking is steadily growing in Sri Lanka and now, many banks in Sri Lanka have applied internet technology services to delivering Internet Banking services to customers. Customers are demanding more banking services which are new levels of convenience and flexibility facilities on top of that it is powerful and easy to use.  Even though this improvement of new technology, recent findings in Sri Lanka demonstrate that consumers were more resistant to adopting such technology even if it has more relative advantages. Generally, less than 1% of total bank customers, use online banking, mobile banking, internet banking, telephone banking and internet payment gateway. Although ATM services are broadly used, the usage of other IT-driven services ", "80": " \n76  such as online banking, mobile banking, internet payment gateway and telebanking is almost insignificant (Suraweera et al. 2011).  Even though most of the customers in the country were aware of internet banking,  they still pay bills, withdraw money, check balances and deposit cheques from bank counters as the traditional way. Even though there is a growth of Internet Banking usage, the usage of Internet Banking seems to be low, relatively to total customers who use banking services in Sri Lanka. So, banks must develop required actions to increase customer adaptation of internet banking.  A study finds internet banking facilities in the People\u2019s Bank by looking at customer adaptation of internet banking. People\u2019s Bank\u2019s Internet banking facilities allow to do a wide range of financial transactional facilities such as real-time, 24/7, making banking more convenient for customers located anywhere in the country. The bank\u2019s internet and mobile banking customer base grew by 53.2% compared to 2015. And also, there were Rs.2.3 million valued internet based payments in 2016 and considering 2017, the customer adaptation internet banking facility was raised as  Rs.3.8 million (People\u2019s Bank Annual Report, 2016).  The following graph (Figure 1) shows the growth of customer adaptation of internet banking facilities in People\u2019s Bank.  Figure 1; Registered customers of internet banking at People\u2019s Bank-Rathnapura branch  \n  Source: 2015 to 2017 registered internet banking customer list of People\u2019s Bank-Rathnapura branch  \n", "81": " \n77  According to the figure 1, 2015 to 2017, 767 registered consumers use the internet banking services in Rathnapura People\u2019s bank. And also, there is a significant increase in the customer adaptation of internet banking in all branches of the People\u2019s Bank. But usage of Internet Banking seems to be low relative to the customers who use banking services. It means, there are 8467 customers of the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch, but only 767 customers are using Internet banking facilities. According to that, registered internet banking customers are less than 10%, from all the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch customers. So, the customer adaption for Internet banking rate is low in relation to the bank customers.  This study observes the factors influencing the adaptation of internet banking facilities by customers of the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch. Awareness programmes of the factors that affect internet banking adaptation is required to increase the customer adaptation of Internet Banking.  Today, most Sri Lankan banks offer internet banking services. Both banks and the customers are benefited from Internet Banking. The customers  gain profits by cost and time saving, convenience and anytime accessibility of internet banking services. And also, the bank  gains benefits such as cost savings, reaching new segments of the population, increased efficiency and better customer service satisfaction.  Internet Banking is a rapidly growing trend in the People\u2019s Bank. This study is an effort to come up  with a solution to the major research problem which can be titled as factors affecting customer adaptation of the internet banking services specially provided by People\u2019s Bank-Rathnapura branch. 2. Literature Review  Various theories are recognized in relation to the customer adaptation of Internet Banking. Based on those theories, several studies have been explored by academics and published their opinions to the world. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Perceived Risks (TPR) are the two major theories primarily used in literature.    ", "82": " \n78  Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)  Davis (1989) was first to introduce the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), where he assumes that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are the major determinants of Internet Banking. Perceived usefulness was defined as \u201cthe degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his/her job performance\u201d, and perceived ease of use is defined as \u201cthe degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of physical and mental effort\u201d (Davis, 1989). The TAM has been successfully applied to accept technologies such as the personal computer, mobile devices and other IT related applications (Davis, 1989). It has also been applied to consumers\u2019 attitudes towards the use of e-commerce or mobile commerce (Gefen, Karahanna, & Straub, 2003).  According to TAM, if a user perceives a specific technology as useful, user will trust in a positive use-performance relationship. Since effort is a limited resource, a user is likely to accept an application when she or he is perceiving it as more straightforward to use than an alternative. Consequently, educational technology with a high level of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use is more likely to encourage positive perceptions.  Several authors have analyzed the website\u2019s features as determinants of the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. According to Davis (1989), system information and service quality determine the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of web retail. While perceived usefulness directly affects attitude and use, perceived ease of use impacts attitude and use indirectly through perceived usefulness. TAM proposes that users communicate a positive attitude toward the technology when they perceive it to be useful and easy to use (Davis, 1989). Theory of Perceived Risks (TPR)  The theory of Perceived Risks (TPR) model proposed a theoretical model which is unfavorably affected for the adaptation of internet banking by the security risk, financial risk, time risk, social risk, physical risk and performance risk. It defined the adverse influence on intent to the usage of internet banking. Six forms of perceived risk have been defined as security, financial, physical, performance, social and time risk (Jacoby and Kaplan, 1972; Kaplan et al., 1974; Roselius, 1971). According to Reavley (2005), the security risk refers as a potential loss due to fraud or a hacker compromising the security ", "83": " \n79  of an online bank user. Financial risk is defined as the potential for monetary loss due to transaction error or bank account misuse. (Kuisma et al., 2007). Performance risk is defined as losses incurred by deficiencies or malfunctions of online banking websites (Kuisma et al., 2007). Lee (2009) stated that social risk of using online banking may result in disapproval of one\u2019s friends, family and work group. Moreover, Forsythe and Shi (2003) define time risk as the loss of the time and inconvenience incurred due to the delays of receiving the payment or the difficulty in  navigation Empirical Review Commercial internet connectivity was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1995 and it was the first time of introducing internet among Asian countries. Sri Lankan commercial banking sector is steadily developing online banking services by providing a wide range of products to their customer (Jayasiri & Weerathunga, 2008).  Internet technology had a steady growth in Sri Lanka. Now, many banks in Sri Lanka have implemented internet technology in their services by providing Internet Banking facilities to their customers. Even though many internet users and many banks are with fully fledged Internet banking services, yet the number of Internet Banking users is less amongst the internet users (Zarook, 2010).  Although the banking professionals interviewed by the researchers themselves are not pleased with this situation, they appear to be contented with the status quo (Suraweera et al, 2011). Though now internet banking is expanding its position from desktop PC to the mobile phonet, there is still a  resistance with the Sri Lankans to get adapted to internet banking which is becoming a huge problem.  Hernandez et al (2007) found that system adaptation is determined by the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are related to attitude and thereby to actual use. According to Lee and Allaway (2002), the adaptation of electronic banking depends on the service firm\u2019s resource management lowering delivery costs and by releasing service personnel to provide better and more varied service.  Demographic variables are the most popular basis for distinguishing customers. Individual differences in consumer behavior have been theorized and associated with the acceptance of new information technology, such as Internet banking (Karjaluoto et al., 2002; Mattila et al., 2003; Sathye, 1999). Consumer\u2019s demographic characteristics have been widely used ", "84": " \n80  to distinguish the difference between segments of customers (Kottler, 2003). The researcher denoted those demographic characteristics as age, sex, income, occupation, education, race, religion, nationality, family size and family life cycle.  Zeithaml et al. (2002) stated that the degree to which an innovation is easy to understand or use could be considered as perceived ease of use. The perceived ease of use is the consumer\u2019s perception that banking on the internet will involve a minimum of effort. Similarly, Consult (2002) noted that perceived ease of use refers to the ability of consumers to experiment with  innovation and evaluate its benefits easily (Mathieson, 1991).  At first, Rogers (1962) that affirmed perceived ease of use is the term that represents the degree to which an innovation is perceived not to be challenging to understand, learn or operate. He further stated that perceived ease of use is the degree to which consumers perceive a new product or service as better than its substitutes (Rogers, 1983). Also, Davis (1989) stated that perceived ease of use could influence the perceived usefulness because the other things being equal easier the technology is to use the more useful it can be. In the context of internet banking, research shows that perceived ease of use (PEU) has a positive and significant effect on the perceived usefulness. Thus, customers are more likely to accept and involve in internet banking services if there is the ease of use in the operation process, which can be instrumental to the utilization of technology and contribute to the individual by reducing transfer costs and improving work performance. Information technologies that are easy to use will be less threatening to the individual (Moon & Kim, 2001).  Suganthi & Balachandran, (2001) highlighted that one of their dimensions \u201cease of use\u201d showing its effect on internet banking adaptation. Therefore, the more the consumer perceives internet banking as easy to use, the more they are likely to the involvement in internet banking.  According to the Technology Acceptance Model, perceived usefulness is the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance their job performance. According to Davis et al. (1992), perceived usefulness refers to the consumers\u2019 perceptions regarding the outcome of the experience. Davis (1993) defined perceived usefulness as the individual\u2019s perception that using the new technology will enhance or improve their performance.  ", "85": " \n81  And also, according to Davis (1989), perceived usefulness (PU) is a significant factor in customer retention in internet banking. PU is defined as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology will enhance his performance. In the context of user acceptance of internet banking services, perceived usefulness could be because of transaction like online request for cheque, demand draft, sending monthly E statement online payments, etc. that improves performance, save time and increase the effectiveness of service or some or several add-on benefits such as bill payments, mobile recharge, etc. These benefits are also expected to be further enhanced over time through technological advancement or breakthroughs.  However, Gerrard and Cunningham (2003) noted that the perceived usefulness depends on the banking services offered such as checking bank balances, applying for a loan, paying utility bills, transferring money abroad, and obtaining information on mutual funds. Tan and Teo (2000) suggested that the perceived usefulness is an important factor in determining the adaptation of innovations. Issues related to security have always been a concern when dealing with technologies related to online transactions, such as e-banking (Chang, 2007). Perceived security is defined as the customers\u2019 perception of the degree of protection against the abovementioned threats.  Thus, the security of internet based banking transactions can be secured with adequate security measures like encryption, digital signatures, and firewalls (Bhimani, 1996).  Bauer (1960) defined risk in terms of uncertainty and consequences associated with a consumer\u2019s actions. Perceived risk increase with uncertainty and/or the magnitude of associated negative consequence (Hsi-Peng et al, 2005). Security risk is defined as \u201ca potential loss due to fraud or a hacker compromising the security of an online bank User\u201d (Reavley, 2005). Security in e-commerce is defined as a threat that creates the \u2018circumstance, condition, or event with the potential to cause economic hardship to data or network resources in the form of destruction, disclosure, modification of data, fraud, and abuse (Kalakota & Whinston, 1997). Wadie (2011) concluded that convenience and security perception positively affect on consumer adaptation of internet banking. All the theories and research studies pave the ways to select the better variables to consider when developing a model to identify the impact of those selected variables on the adaptation of internet banking services.

Conceptualization The researcher selected the customer adaptation for Internet banking services as the dependent variable of the research, which is primarily interested. Customer adaptation of Internet banking affects by several independent variables. The conceptual model derived from the literature survey for this research is shown in below. The study focused on how the demographic factors, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived security affect the customer adaptation of internet banking. Independent variables                  Figure 2: Conceptual Framework (developed by researcher)  3.2 Population and Sample of the Research Both primary and secondary data were utilized to enhance the objectives of this study and structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data.  Moreover, Secondary data were gathered from the data published by the People\u2019s bank. Questionnaires were distributed among customers of the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch. The questionnaire comprises questions on selected eight factors that affect customer adaptation to Internet banking.  The population includes the entire group of people, events or things of interest that the researcher wishes to investigate.

There are 767 registered customers of Internet banking in Rathnapura branch. Sample size was determined according to the recommended sample size of Green\u2019s (1991). He recommended using one of the two formulas as N> or = 50 + 8m or N> or = 104 + m (where m= number of independent variables). The second formula is 114 (104+8). According to this formula, the sample size of this study was 114 respondents. However, the researcher has increased the sample size to 130. According to that, the researcher selected 130 registered internet banking customers as the sample size.  The sampling method used in the research was convenience sampling which is one of the non-Probability sampling methods. 3.3 Data Analysis Tools The study uses different statistical methods to analyze the data including reliability, validity, normality, correlation and regression model. Kurtosis and skewness were used to measure the normality of the data set. And also, correlation was used to measure the association between dependent and independent variables. Finally, a regression model was used to test the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable.  4. Results and Discussion Gender, age, marital status, education level and occupation of customers were used as the demographic variables of this study. Perceived ease of use, Perceived usefulness and Perceived security were used as other independent variables that impact customer adaptation to Internet banking services.  Relationship between Customer adaptation of Internet Banking and gender of customers  According to the research objectives, to identify the association between gender and customer adaptation t theo internet banking, the Chi-squared test was used.

Multi co-linearity analysis  Multi co-linearity is a problem that occurs with regression analysis when there is a high correlation of at least one independent variable with a combination of the other independent variables. When variables are highly correlated in a multiple regression analysis, it is difficult to identify the unique contribution of each variable in predicting the dependent variable because the highly correlated variables are predicting the same variance in the dependent variable. In this situation, the overall p-value may be significant, but the p-value for each predictor may not be significant. Multi co-linearity exists when the Tolerance value is below 0.1 and VIF is greater than 10 (Sekaran, 2010).

And also, 20.6% of the variation in customer adaptation to internet banking cannot be described by these three variables alone.  According to Chan (2004), Durbin-Watson value can be used to test the independency of the data. It ranges from 0-4 and values near to 0 indicate strong positive and near to 4 indicates a strong negative relationship. Value is near to 2 shows that data points are independent. Since the value of the Durbin- Watson estimate in this study is 1.790, the independency assumption is not violated.    ", "94": " \n90  4.9.

H1G- Perceived usefulness has a significant impact on the customer adaptation to Internet Banking.  H0G- Perceived usefulness does not have any significant impact on the customer adaptation to Internet Banking.  H1H- Perceived security has a significant impact on the customer adaptation to Internet Banking.  H0H- Perceived security does not have any significant impact on the customer adaptation to Internet Banking.  According to Table 9, P-value for all three variables reported as 0.000. Since it is less than 0.05 there are enough evidences to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, it can be concluded that the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived security have  significant effects on the customer adaptation to the internet banking in the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch.  5. Conclusion  This study focuses on investigating the factors influencing the customer adaptation to internet banking services in the People\u2019s Bank-Rathnapura branch. According to the previous literature it was found that  the three main factors influencing customer adaptation to internet banking services are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived security. In addition to that, demographic variables of respondents were also taken into consideration as variables which have impacts on the adaptation to the internet banking services of customers. The study used two statistical tools (Chi-squared test and multiple regression method) to analyze the collected data for enhancing the research objectives. According to the Chi-squared test, there is a relationship between the customer adaptation to internet banking of the People\u2019s bank with the age and marital status as P-value is less than critical P-value ", "96": " \n92  (0.05). And also, it proved that there is no association between the gender, educational level and occupation with the customer adaptation to internet banking services of the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch.  According to the regression output, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived security had a positive influence on the customer adaptation to internet banking services as P-values being less than 0.05. This study proved that the independent variables as age, marital status, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived security were significantly associated with the customer adaptation to internet banking of the People\u2019s bank-Rathnapura branch. Managers are advised to provide more potential information to the customers about internet banking through the bank assistants at the branch. The information may include references to usefulness, time saving, convenience anywhere, low cost, high security and information availability. The internet banking service providers are suggested to offer smart packages for the users to motivate and enhance the usage of internet banking services. Customer-friendly systems should be introduced for the ease of use. References Bauer, A. (1960). Consumer behavior as risk taking in dynamic marketing in a changing world.

Department of Accountancy & Finance, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka  Abstract This study investigates the moderator effect of gender when analyzing the customers\u2019 behavioral intention towards internet banking in Sri Lanka. Seven theoretically chosen determinants (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Trust, Social Influence, Self-efficacy, Risk and Image) of behavioral intention were tested for the moderator effect of gender using linear regression analysis. Results indicated that only the relationships between intention towards internet banking and perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were significantly moderated by gender. Meanwhile, a significant gender effect is not observed through the other determinants (Trust, Social influence, Self-efficacy, Risk, and Image) of internet banking penetration.   Keywords: Behavioral Intention, Gender, Internet Banking, Moderator Effect. 1. Introduction  Internet usage has significantly increased in Sri Lanka during the last decade. The internet penetration rate in 2018 was 32 percent and it is growing at a significant rate  every year (Jebamani et. al 2018). Similarly, when considering the internet-based communication services in Sri Lanka, social media usage reaches a broader audience day by day. Further, the broad brand subscriptions of the country recorded a rapid growth since 2010 and continued to grow in years after (Department of Census and Statistics, 2018). Thus, technology adaptation in Sri Lanka can be hypothesized to grow at a rapid pace in the future too.  Meanwhile, the banking sector has been integrated with technology to serve its clients faster and conveniently. Emerging technologies have led the banking industry to change from paper-based banking to digitalized banking services. It is apparent that, among the ", "101": " \n97  different types of technological improvements that are adopted within the banking industry, internet technology is playing a major role in the development of banking activities. Banks act as intermediates among financial transactions by providing numerous types of banking services to their corporate and retail customers. A decade ago most of the banking transactions were carried out manually and customers had to visit the branch and wait in huge queues even to do a small transaction. This condition made disadvantages to both the customers and banks as it incurred a high cost as well as consumed time unnecessarily. Therefore, banks implemented innovative technological solutions by shifting traditional branch banking to an online web-based banking system. This transformation improved the internal efficiency and enabled efficiently delivering services, which led to customer satisfaction and loyalty in long term (Premathilaka, 2018).  The application of the internet to the banking sector has removed the barriers of time, distance, and accessibility of the traditional banking system due to its anywhere and anytime accessibility. Furthermore, this transformation gained more advantages for both the banks and the customers. Customers benefited in terms of convenience, savings of time and cost, availability of any time banking services. In return, banks gained a competitive advantage through attracting new customers, increased brand image and revenue, expanding market area, and reducing other distribution channels and costs (Shah, 2009).  When considering Sri Lankan status of internet banking, Premathilaka (2018) stated that Sri Lanka is known as the first South Asian country which introduced commercial internet services. In 1999, Union Bank offered the first internet banking services to the country to provide banking activities conveniently and efficiently. Today, the banking sector consisted of 26 Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), including 13 domestic and 13 foreign banks (CBSL, 2018). Nearly, all commercial banks facilitate online banking services in a broader range.  Sri Lanka is considered as one of the best potential market places to develop internet banking services due to several reasons. Firstly, as earlier mentioned, consumers have a better technological environment to get adapted to internet banking. Secondly, in the present, the majority of customers are aware of internet banking and the advantages of using it. Thirdly, many private banks, public investors, and government greatly spend on ", "102": " \n98  e-commerce and banking innovations including self-service technologies like internet banking.  Though, Sri Lanka shows potential for developing internet banking services, the user rate of online banking has not increased much, which means that there is still a lag behind (CBSL, 2016). Also, the usage level of internet banking remains at a low level compared to the developed and developing countries in the region. Since the usage remains low, there is a matter arising in behavioral intention in this regard. According to Fishbein & Ajzen, (1975) an individual\u2019s performance of a specific behavior is determined by his/her behavioral intentions. Therefore, a consumer\u2019s behavioral intention would play a major role in the efficiency and success of the internet banking system. However, consumers\u2019 intention heavily depends on their beliefs and perceptions. Therefore, bankers need to pay attention to the factors that inhibit or motivate customers to use internet banking services.  Previously, many researchers have  studied  this concern considering the entire consumers as a whole unit. Thus, they provide a general understanding in this respect. But this behavioral intention may not be general, the overall intention of one\u2019s would differ from another one due to their unique beliefs and perceptions. Further, it may change along with different demographical subgroups and individuals prospects.   In this regard, considering gender subgroup in the technology acceptance, various studies have been focused on the impact of gender role either as an independent or as a moderate variable (i.e. Venkatesh, 2000; Venkatesh ,2003; 2012). Similarly, in the global context, much previous literature has been proven that males\u2019 behavior towards using internet banking might be different from females\u2019 behavior (Li, 2011; Yuen, 2013). Therefore, this study examines whether males\u2019 intention differs from females\u2019 when using internet banking services in the Sri Lankan context.  2. Literature Review Many previous researchers have considered the role of gender, either as an independent or moderate variable, when assessing technological acceptance. The word \u201cgender\u201d refers to social and cultural differences rather than biological one which is donated by males and ", "103": " \n99  females. In the internet banking context, following literature evidenced that, gender plays a significant role in determining the intention of accepting internet banking services.  Ghamdi (2011) conducted a research relating to gender perception towards internet banking loyalty and the study concluded that male behavior towards internet banking might be different from female\u2019 behavior. The findings clarify that gender perceptions and behaviors towards internet banking differ and social influence has a significant effect on male behavior but not in the case of female behavior.  Similarly, Venkatesh (2000) established that gender is a vital predictor of technology acceptance and usage, as well as female, tends to be influenced by social influence when compared to males.    Yuen (2013) conducted a study by focusing on cultural differences in internet banking acceptance in the United States and Malaysia. Results revealed that Malaysian females have significantly higher behavioral intention to use internet banking services compared to their counterparts in the United States. Also, Males exhibited no significant difference in behavioral intention to use internet banking services in both countries. Similarly, Akinci et al. (2004) conducted a study in Turkey related to internet banking adaptation, and findings revealed that men expressed a higher intention to use internet banking than females.  Meanwhile, Dwivedi et al., (2015) studied whether Jordanian customers\u2019 perceptions of intention and use of internet banking services vary according to their demographic characteristics named age, gender, income, education, and customers\u2019 experience with the computer and internet. They found that there was no significant difference between consumer perception and gender. Riquelme (2010) conducted a research  in Singapore on the moderating effect of gender in the adaptation of mobile banking usefulness, social norms, and social risk, in this order, are the factors that influence the intention to adopt mobile banking services the most. Ease of use has a stronger influence on female respondents than male, whereas relative advantage has a stronger effect on the perception of usefulness on male respondents. Social norms (or the importance of others in the decision), also influence adaptation more strongly among female respondents than male.  Subsequently, Venkatesh et al. (2013) stated that the decisions to adopt the technology by men are mainly determined by the perceived usefulness of technology use, while women are more influenced by their perceptions about a system\u2019s ease of use and social influences. Lichtenstein et al. (2006) conducted a research study regarding consumer adaptation of ", "104": " \n100  internet banking services and they have confirmed most of the findings discussed above regarding the gender differences regarding the Australian context. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is an impact of gender on the intention to get adapted to internet banking as well as these studies support the idea that gender roles can create group-differences in the case of consumers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions. However, in the Sri Lankan context, it has been found that very few previous studies have been tested a technology adaptation model to understand the intentions of different gender groups. Specially, no one has tested how the gender moderates the relationship between the determinants of technology acceptance and internet banking penetration. Thus, this study attempts to fill the above empirical gap by studying whether gender moderates the individual\u2019s beliefs and perceptions towards internet banking usage in Sri Lanka.  3. Development of Hypothesis The theoretical and empirical literature provides evidence for several factors as significant on the internet banking penetration. In the following section, those factors are explored in a way to emphasize the potential of gender in moderating the relationship among them and internet banking penetration. Perceived Usefulness (PU) is defined as \u201cthe degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job or life performance (Venkatesh, 2000). The ultimate reason that people tend to use online banking services is that they find the system to be useful in doing their banking transactions (Malhotra et al., 2014). From a gender perspective, earlier studies have been shown that PU is more important to men than women because \u201cmen are more likely to consider the value of money, financial activities and performance rather than women\u201d (Venkatesh, 1996). However, in the current era, with the extension of the female\u2019s family role, they are required to use and manage IT to enhance and complete their household tasks. The tasks associated with banking activities such as account transfers, depositing money, bill payments, etc. have been considered as females\u2019 responsibility. In addition, a large number of females now engage in jobs and most of them are financially independent. Accordingly, they need to manage their banking activities as well as their families\u2019. Internet banking has enabled females to reduce the time spent on it and traveling to banks or ATMs. On the other hand, women who are busy with household work and childcare have less or no time to go to the bank and spent time in long queues. ", "105": " \n101  Therefore, internet banking enables them to do their banking transactions at night or any free time due to its 24/7 availability.  Perceived Ease of Use is also considered as a significant determinant of internet banking penetration. It has been defined as \u201cthe degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort\u201d (Venkatesh, 2000). Consumers perceive that the internet banking is easier to use if it is user-friendly, easy to operate and remember. So if it is easier to use, particular technology users more likely to accept it (Bashir, 2015). From a gender perspective, females normally perceive IT to be more difficult to use than males do (Teo, 1996).  But that condition has been changed over the past period because today, the most internet banking websites are designed for public use, user-oriented, and without regarding user\u2019s attributes. Moreover, IT education is now compulsory for all genders which enabled females to overcome their computer anxiety and become confident in IT usage at work or home. In the Sri Lankan context, the rapid growth of female internet users in the workplace, education, and communication (i.e. email and social media) may question why internet banking is not perceived as easy to use by females than  males. Because with the increasing number of females in the workforce and the continued growth of computer usage in the workplace, females are also enabled to easily use internet-based services.  In the context of internet banking services, trust is defined as \u201cthe assured confidence a consumer has in the internet banking service provider\u2019s ability to provide reliable services through the Internet\u2019. In the internet banking environment, consumers give more importance to trust than branch banking (Ratnasingham, 1988). When consumers feel confident in banker\u2019s ability to provide a reliable service, they believe that they are secured and no privacy threats and that will lead to being more trustworthy with internet banking transactions. So, considering gender differentiation, men are likely to trust internet banking than women do. Because as earlier mentioned, while women  value emotional things, men like to improve their financial performance and skills by doing transactions through the internet so that they keep their trust with online banking (Tsikriktsis, 2002).  Social influence is the next factor that is considered significant in this regard. It is defined as \u201cthe persons\u2019 perception that most people such as friends, family, colleagues, peers and social group, who are important to him think he should or should not use the internet banking services\u201d. Lee (2009) has noted that customers\u2019 behavior can be influenced by various social entities including friends, family, neighbors, colleagues, superiors, etc.  ", "106": " \n102  Venkatesh (1996) stated that women are more caring about the quality of life, emotions, social communication while men rely on self-confidence, own beliefs, and gathering individual experiences. Similarly, Venkatesh (2000) specified that social influence is more important for women because as a group, they are more expressive, more aware of others\u2019 feelings, and more compliant than men. So, in this study, researchers expect the effect of social influence on internet banking would be stronger for women compared to men.  Mitchell, (1999) stated that consumers consider all uncertainties and probable adverse effects when they make buying decisions of products and services. When considering the online environment consumers\u2019 perception of risk increases where negative outcomes or uncertainty is high. Mainly, it is due to the customer loses the face to face interaction with the bank assistants. Examples for this sort of uncertainties include fear of hacking, losing passwords, losing money with transactions, making errors while making transactions, etc. These generate positive risk perception and it will be negatively affected to the users\u2019 intention. Generally, females are known as risk-averse, and males risk-takers. In the internet banking context, it is also considered that women have more fear to engage in internet-based transactions because of it\u2019s inherent nature of risk. Therefore, their intention on internet banking usage will be negatively associated with the perceived risk.  Self-efficacy, which is defined as an individual\u2019s self-confidence in his or her ability to perform a particular behavior or action. In this study, self-efficacy is treated as an individual\u2019s belief about his ability to use internet banking on his own. Agarwal et al., (2000) state that there is a casual relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral intention. Females are perceived information technology more difficult to use than males do. Jackson et al. (2001) specified that \u201cFemales are also reported to have higher levels of computer anxiety, less computer self-efficacy, and less favorable and less stereotypical attitudes towards computers\u201d. But in respect of this \u201cMen have taken more technology classes and are more likely to have had a computer in their room, which provides more opportunities to experiment and acquire confidence and skills associated with digital technologies\u201d (Correa, 2010).    Similarly, Image, which is defined as \u201cthe degree to which the use of an innovation is perceived to enhance one\u2019s image or status in his/her social system\u201d (Moore, 1991), is also a significant determinant of internet banking penetration. If important members of an ", "107": " \n103  individual's social group (e.g., peers, friends, family, and colleagues) think that he or she should use some particular system and at that point using that system will be likely to enhance his or her social status within the group then such person will perceive using that technology (e.g. Internet banking) will directly or indirectly lead to enhance his/her image in the particular social system.  Traditionally, men are viewed as the financial providers and women have been viewed as caretakers. Therefore, men are more likely to focus on performance, financial activities, and value of money rather than women do (Venkatesh, 1996). According to Kennedy (2003) women are seen as primarily responsible for home care, childcare, and family reproduction thus people in many countries and cultures believe doing housework produces no income, and women are seen as living off the earnings of men. So that, condition has been led to consider women as with lower social status.  4. Methodology  The main purpose of this study is to find out whether gender moderates the consumers\u2019 intention to adopt internet banking regarding their beliefs and Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Trust (TR), Social Influence (SI), Self-efficacy (SE), Risk (PR) and Image (PI). Here, firstly the researcher did a literature survey regarding internet banking adaptation and through that seven constructs were identified which showed a direct effect with consumers\u2019 intention. The data collection instrument was developed based on the previously tested questionnaire by the various studies relating to internet banking and mobile banking. A pilot survey was conducted to refine and assess the questionnaire instrument. According to the results of the pilot survey, some redundant questions were eliminated and some were adjusted to enable better understanding and avoid erroneous interpretations. Questionnaire items were formulated as Likert-type statements anchored by a five-point scale ranging from 1 (\u2018strongly disagree\u2019) to 5 (\u2018strongly agree\u2019).  As the research site of the study, researcher selected the Wennappuwa area which is located in Puttalam district. The convenience sampling method was used to select respondents and the sample size was calculated by using the published table of Krejcie and Morgan (1970). Data was collected from two hundred seventy-seven (277) customers who are currently using and not using internet banking services including both genders. Data received from the questionnaires were analyzed through statistical analysis with the help of the SPSS 16th ", "108": " \n104  version. Multiple linear regression analysis is used to analyze the set of data in order to find the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.  The following model is used in this regard; \ud835\udc4c= \ud835\udefd0+\ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56+\ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56+\ud835\udf00 Where Y is the dependent variable; IVi is the ith independent variable; Mi is the gender moderator developed for the ith independent variable. As this study concentrates on seven potential determinants of internet banking penetration, seven gender mediators need to be generated. Thus, to get rid of the multicollinearity issue seven two factor models, as specified in the above equation, are to be analyzed.    5. Data Analysis  The researcher identified the relevant variables and conducted a factor analysis before running the model. Here, the researchers used factor analysis to create regression variables. According to Eigen values of the factor analysis, eight components were extracted, which were then identified as the dependent and the seven independent variables that are used with this study. Correlation Coefficient Analysis    The purpose of correlation analysis is to identify whether two measurement variables associates, and to quantify the strength of the association between the variables: PU, PEU, TR, SI, SE, PR, PI\u201d and the dependent variable: \u201cBehavioral intention\u201d. Table 4.1 depicts the Pearson correlations that were calculated in this regard.   Table 4.1: Correlation Coefficient of dependent variables  Variable  Pearson correlation  P-Value  PU  0.349  0.000*  PEU  0.349  0.000*  TR  0.179  0.003*  SI  0.106  0.077  SE  0.354  0.000*  PR  -0.149  0.013*  PI  0.444  0.000*  Source: (Survey data, 2019) (significant at 5% - *)  Note: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Trust (TR), Social Influence (SI), Self-efficacy (SE), Risk (PR) and Image (PI). ", "109": " \n105  According to table 4.1, as expected, PU, PEU, TR, SE, PI shows a positive association with behavioral intention and the statistics are statistically significant.  It is a strong evidence to say that PU, PEU, TR, SE, PI increases consumers\u2019 overall intention to go for internet banking.  The association for PR and internet banking is -0.149 and it expresses a significantly negative association. Thus, it evidences that when PR increases consumers\u2019 intention to use internet banking is decreasing.   Moderate effect of gender  When finding the moderator effect of gender, initially the researcher tested whether the attribute of gender has a significant effect on each independent variable and in the second step to find out how gender moderates the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.  Table 4.2: Summary of analysis of variance   Variables  Sig  PU, Gender  0.000*  PEU, Gender  0.000*  TR, Gender  0.009*  SI ,Gender  0.125  SE, Gender  0.000*  PR ,Gender  0.045*  PI, Gender  0.000*  Source: (Survey data, 2019)  Note: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Trust (TR), Social Influence (SI), Self-efficacy (SE), Risk (PR) and Image (PI). The researcher used regression models to test whether there is an impact of gender on behavioral intention. This is tested separately for each and every dependent variable.  According to the results of table 4.2, except (Gen, SI) other relationships (Gen, PU), (Gen, PEU), (Gen, T), (Gen, PR),  (Gen, PI) and (Gen, SE) were statistically significant. This indicates that gender is significantly affecting on the consumers\u2019 intention on internet banking by way of perceptions of Usefulness, Ease of use, Trust, Self-Efficacy, Risk, and Image.   ", "110": " \n106  Thereafter the researcher-developed standardized variables to create moderate variables that help to properly identify whether gender moderates the relationship between each independent variable and dependent variable (BI) in the proposed model.  To achieve the objective of the study, which is to investigate out how gender moderates the relationship between behavioral intention and consumers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions (PU, PEU, T, SI, SE, PR, and PI) the researcher used linear regression models as earlier. For this analysis, moderate variables (M1- M7) were developed and included in the regressions models.

According to the reported results in table 4.3, the moderators M1 and M2 are statistically significant. This means that there is a significant effect of M1 and M2 on the relationship between PU and BI also PEU and BI respectively. Therefore, it indicates that gender significantly moderates the relationship between PU and BI as well as PEU and BI. Further, when considering M3, M4, M5, M6, and M7 all these moderator variables are statistically insignificant because the p-value is greater than 0.05 alpha value.

Accordingly, the researcher found that gender does not ", "111": " \n107  create a difference between the above-mentioned relationships regarding consumers\u2019 beliefs and perceptions in the context of internet banking usage in Sri Lanka.   5. Conclusion  Internet banking is becoming much popular due to its convenience and flexibility. Banks are increasingly promoting online banking services to enhance their customer base while becoming efficient and cost-effective. This research has been conducted to study the customers\u2019 behavioral intention towards internet banking in Sri Lanka to examine the gender differences in their perceptions. The study has found some significant results regarding gender perceptions on Usefulness and Ease of Use. In the case of females, usefulness and ease of use were found to have a significant effect on their intention to use internet banking. In other words, as proven by the hypothesis, females consider that internet banking is a more useful and easily useable system for them than their male counterparts. In Sri Lanka, the inequality in computer knowledge between males and females has been significantly reduced due to the changes in workplaces and the education system. Thus, it has been reduced the difference in levels of IT competence and usage between these genders. As they show, either the traditional social role of males in society may still affect technology acceptance, females are now having the same opportunities as their male counterparts at work, in education, and IT usage. This may be a result that females are perceiving internet banking as more useful, easier to use, and more favorable. As well as males are less frequent users of counter services at banks due to their work restrictions. Therefore, they have been shifted their responsibilities to their female parties. Thus, the tasks associated with banking activities such as money transfers, depositing money, bill payments, etc. have been considered further responsibilities of females. But due to the busyness of women's role in households or workplaces, females have been found that internet banking is more useful than visiting the branch bank and wait in long queues.   When considering the trust perception, earlier studies show that the trust plays a significant role in determining consumer\u2019s behavior towards internet banking. In this study, results found that trust was not considered as a significant factor by customers (both males and females) on their usage intention of internet banking. This may be due to increased consumers\u2019 confidence towards internet banking than the earlier stages. Banks have been able to increase and maintain the trustworthiness of consumers on internet banking by ", "112": " \n108  implementing or changing their trust-building strategies, advertising campaigns, data, and privacy protection procedures, or through other ways of doing.  Further, the study hypothesized that social influence, perceived risk, perceived image and self-efficacy significantly impact on the intention to use internet banking. But, there are no significant differences in gender perceptions in this regard. However, previous researchers have found varied results regarding gender roles and individual\u2019s perceptions. Considering social influence, Lee & Li (2011) show that male behavior is more likely to be affected by the members in the society such as their families and friends. But his findings were not supported by the Gefen & Straub (1997) and Venkatesh (2000), as they found that females are also more affected by the other parties\u2019 opinions when they make decisions. While considering the perceived risk, the researcher identified  that the consumers still consider risky situations when they make decisions to select or not to select to use internet banking services. Also, existing researches prove that perceived risk has a negative influence on consumers\u2019 behavioral intention (Chiou, 2012; Lee, 2009).  The results of this study further specified that the perceived image has a significant impact on consumers\u2019 intention.  Kelman (1958) stated that individuals often respond to social normative influences to create or continue a favorable image within a reference group. Therefore, individuals may perceive that using the internet banking system will also lead to their image enhancement.  References  Agarwal, R. (1998).

Department of Accountancy & Finance, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka miuni.shamika@gmail.com*  Abstract Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) plays a vital role in the stock market by enhancing market efficiency, creating a non-debt source of capital and increasing stock market liquidity. Foreign investors enter into the stock market through stock purchases and exit through the sale of stocks. The impact of foreign investments on the stock market differs according to the nature of the foreign transaction. Thus, this study aims to investigate the relationship between FPI and individual sector performance of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) using the data from 2007 to 2017. In order to examine the impact of FPI based on the nature of the transaction, foreign purchases and foreign sales are considered as two independent variables along with exchange rate (LKR/USD) deployed as a control variable. Sector indices are used as the proxy to measure the sector performance and employed Auto Regressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) bound test to enhance the purpose. The findings reveal that nine sectors: Banking Finance & Insurance (BFI), Beverage Food & Tobacco (BFT), Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals (C&P), Diversified Holdings (DIV), Footwear and Textiles (F&T), Hotels and Travels (H&T), Plantation (PLT), Power and Energy (P&E) and Telecommunication (TLE) have a significant positive relationship with foreign purchases, foreign sales and exchange rate in the long run while the short-run relationship is not strong. The key findings of this study suggest future implications for current and potential investors, stockbrokers and policymakers to formulate strategies in managing FPI.

Background   The Sri Lankan capital market is an attractive destination for foreign investors as it affords an opportunity to diversify their investments. As stated in the Capital Market Progress Report (2014), Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has a low correlation with other capital markets and it trades at discount compared to most frontier and emerging markets. Some literature supports the fact that foreign investments increase the stock market performance. El-Wassal (2005) stated that economic growth, financial liberalization policies, and foreign portfolio investments were the leading factors of the emerging stock markets growth. Pal (2006) in his study stated that the entry of foreign portfolio investors will boost a country's stock market and subsequently the economy. Yartey (2008) proved the fact in emerging economies and discovered that private capital flows are among the important determinants of stock market development in selected 42 emerging market countries. Moreover, some research findings emphasise that Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPI) are attracted to stock market performance. For example, Kumara & Dayaratne (2015) explored that London Inter-Bank Offered Rates (LIBOR), foreign reserves presented in months of imports; USD/LKR exchange rate and domestic share market performance measured by the All Share Price Index (ASPI) are statistically significant and have a long-run positive effect on Equity Foreign Portfolio Investment. The ultimate goal of a country is the sustainable economic growth. It is a proven fact that stock market development and other institutional and macroeconomic variables play an important role in economic growth. Many researchers have proven a strong positive relationship between stock market development and economic growth. Sri Lankan scholars such as Dayaratne & Wijethunga (2015) and Jahfer & Inoue (2014) have proven the relevance of the fact to the CSE and stated that, there is long term equilibrium between stock market development and economic growth in Sri Lanka. Stock market investments; both domestic and foreign investors should be encouraged to develop the stock market. The literature and current requirement of increasing investments provide opportunities to address the research issue of interest; whether there is a significant relationship between FPI and the performance of the CSE.  The study has two main aims, firstly to investigate the relationship between foreign portfolio investment and sectoral performance and secondly, to explore the short run and long run dynamics of both foreign portfolio investment and sector performance. Most ", "118": " \n114  researchers identify the impact of FPI on stock market performance considering the stock market as a whole. However, when practically analysing, it is clear that several sectors do not get a significant contribution from FPI. Therefore, this paper investigates the sectorial performance to document the level of impact of FPI to particular sectors. The study recognizes the short run and long run association of FPI and sector performance to shed light on the dynamic of the portfolio flows, leading to sector performance. In addition, it aims to provide an understanding of the performance of individual sectors in short run and long run which could assist the investors when creating their portfolios.   The study tests the sector performance with foreign portfolio purchases and sales separately. Unlike considering the net purchases, this research will provide a clear image of which variable; purchases or sales has the most significant impact on the sector performance. Further, the study deploys the LKR/USD exchange rate as a control variable along with foreign purchases and sales to eliminate the spuriousness as well as to strengthen the explanatory ability of the model. The exchange rate can affect both the independent variable; FPI and the dependent variable; sector performance. The \u201cFlow-oriented\u201d theory and \u201cStock-oriented\u201d theory which are further elaborated in the theoretical review enlightens the impact of exchange rate on the share performance. Further, the study conducted by Kasman (2003) proved the long-run stable relationship between stock indices and exchange rate and stated that there is one-way causality from exchange rate to industry sector indices. The impact of exchange rate on FPI can be identified in the Pull and Push Factor theory. This theory discusses the country-specific economic forces that pull investments into the country and global economic forces that push the investment towards outside countries. Scholars such as Oke et al. (2020) and Kumara & Dayaratne (2015) showed that the exchange rate is among the significant pull factors which attract the foreign investments into the host country. In addition, the study employs the sector indices to proxy the sector performance. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 states the theoretical justification of the research and the empirical literature review is presented under section 3. The data and the sample period of the study are summarized in section 4. In section 5, a brief description of the selected variables is given and the statistical models and justification for the methodology is examined in section 6. The results are presented and discussed in section 7 while the concluding remarks are given in section 8.      ", "119": " \n115  2. Theoretical Background The theoretical span of capital inflows can be viewed in the context of saving-investment-capital accumulation theories where it describes the fundamental economic variables underneath the capital flows. However, international trade induced the economies to move towards an open economy and then Balance of Payment (BOP) came into play afterwards. Despite the fact, some economies benefitted from international trade, many developing and underdeveloped economies began to struggle with the BOP crises since the 1970s. This led the developing nations to import capital to bridge the lack, creating globalization and cross border capital flows in the world economy (Marty, 1961). This persuaded more studies in the area and formulated theories relating to capital flows and the emergence of theories of capital and financial markets and macroeconomic factors. The theories dominating the flow of foreign investment have been the Standard Neoclassical theory of foreign portfolio inflows which predicts that capital should flow from capital-rich countries to capital-scarce countries, and the Lucas Paradox (1990) or why private capital doesnot seem to flow from rich to poor countries. Despite the general theories related to international capital flows, the current study follows the \u201cPrice Pressure Hypothesis\u201d as the theoretical base for foreign portfolio investment and stock market performance.  Price pressure hypothesis explains the interactive relationship between portfolio flows and stock market return. Elliott et al. (2006) stated that the index changes are associated with demand shocks which would temporarily cause in a rise or decline in share prices. This buying or selling pressure causes the stock prices to diverge from its equilibrium level. As soon as the stock prices rise or fall it will automatically minimize the excess demand to attract sellers or buyers, supplying with immediate liquidity. In addition, when the stock market faces larger order flows the market makers have to incur higher maintaining costs to retain an adequate inventory level. As the market makers revise stock prices accordingly the observed changes in the riskiness of their inventory, that costs are reflected in that relevant security\u2019s bid-ask spread. Thus, the security prices return to an equilibrium level when demand shock was balanced.  Empirical evidences revealed that two schools of thought related to the exchange rate came into consideration namely, \u201cFlow-oriented\u201d theory and \u201cStock-oriented\u201d theory. The Flow-oriented theory discusses the impact of exchange rate appreciation or depreciation on the stock price under two aspects. In the first, it states that depreciation in domestic currency ", "120": " \n116  would increase the competitiveness of domestic goods compared to foreign goods and the result would collectively accelerate the domestic demand and supply. The second aspect describes that depreciation of exchange rate would impact the stock prices. It suggests that when the exchange rate depreciates, the firms would increase their share prices based on the expected future cash flows expected to flow in due to the increase in aggregate demand (Dornbusch & Fischer, 1980). The Stock-oriented theory explains the impact of stock market price level movements in determining the exchange rate. It assumes that the exchange rate creates equilibrium among demand and supply of the various assets such as; domestic money, domestic bonds, and foreign securities. Due to the integration between foreign and domestic market price levels, an increase in the price levels of the foreign stock market will cause to a rise in the domestic stock market prices (Guomundsson, 2014). 3. Literature Review  FPI is an equity source of capital which flows through the stock market to a country. Evans (2002) stated several benefits of FPI to the domestic capital markets as; it increases the liquidity and market efficiency, brings expert knowledge, and helps to promote the shareholders\u2019 voice in corporate governance. As revealed in the fact finding survey, unlike the domestic investors, foreign investors are more analytical about market movements, and they quickly response to an anticipated change in stock market movement. Thus, they prefer to invest in high capitalization markets to exit from the market without impacting the share price quickly. On the other hand, they immediately buy a large number of shares when they forecast positive movements of the share price. Eniekezimene (2013) finds that a 100% change in FPI would lead to approximately 2% increase in market capitalization. Further, the study tested the impact of foreign investments on domestic investments using the proxy; Return on Domestic Investment (RODI). The results indicated that FPI has significant positive impact on RODI. However, the material impact of FPI on stock market development is yet debateable among scholars. Studies relating to FPI and the domestic stock markets find positive involvement of FPI in assisting the domestic stock market (Patro & Wald, 2005; Kim & Singal, 2000). Eventually, the better access to funding provided by the free flow of portfolio investments contributes to efficient provision of capital in an economy (Raghuram & Zingales, 1998; Wurgler, 2000).   ", "121": " \n117  Similarly, Yartey (2008) examined the institutional and macroeconomic determinants of stock market development using panel data of 42 emerging economies from 1990 to 2004. The findings revealed that macroeconomic factors such as income level, gross domestic investment, banking sector development, private capital flows, and stock market liquidity are important determinants of stock market development. Thus, the study evidenced that FPI has a significant impact on stock market development in emerging markets. Some scholars consider both foreign direct investments (FDI) and FPI as capital flows. In light of the stock market, it is proved that only FPI would have significant influence on stock market development. Moreover, Ifeakachukwu (2015) investigated the relationship between capital inflows and stock market development in Nigeria for the period spanning 1986 to 2013 and it considered both FDI and FPI to proxy the capital inflow while stock market development was proxy by market capitalization, turnover ratio and value traded ratio. The results revealed that only market capitalization and value traded ratio had a significant influence on FPI while none of the measures of stock market development significantly influenced FDI in the long run in Nigeria.  Although foreign investors bring large amounts of capital, due to asymmetric information and home bias, they tend to invest only in certain stocks, rather than in the market as a whole. Therefore, the benefits of foreign investment may be limited and stock price dispersion may exist between foreign favoured stocks and un-favoured stocks Hsu (2013) and the study further compared the performance of favoured and un-favoured stocks of foreign investors. The findings showed that the foreign investor favoured group outperformed the other only during the economic expansion and during recession; the foreign investor un-favoured group performed better. There are foreign favoured stocks and un-favoured stocks in every stock market including CSE. As Hsu (2013) has emphasized, these sectors would not response equally to the movements in FPI. The current study further extended the idea by using the sector indices in CSE.  Exchange rate is expected to have significant relationship with FPI as well as with stock performance. For example, Rujiravanich (2012) investigated the impact of foreign portfolio investment on stock prices and exchange rate in Thailand. It used net foreign portfolio as the proxy for FPI, the exchange rate of baht per US dollar and SET index data to proxy the stock prices. The results showed that the stock prices had a long-run positive relationship with net foreign portfolio investment, while the exchange rate had a long-run ", "122": " \n118  negative relationship with the net foreign portfolio investment. Also, the high market return was a factor that influenced foreign equity securities investment in the stock market. There are controversies in which way the two variables; exchange rate and stock performance are connected and through which channels. Wu et al. (2012) investigated the relationship between US dollar exchange rate and the Philippine stock exchange performance. The study used the granger causality technique and co-integration technique to evaluate the impact and the results suggested there is a bidirectional relationship between exchange rate and stock market performance in the Philippines. Moreover, Jamil & Ullah (2012) test the relationship between the exchange rate and the banking industry in Australian stock exchange and found that there is a positive long-run relationship existing between two variables. Furthermore, Jumah (2013) stated that there is a positive correlation between exchange rate and stock market returns in Mexico. Thus, the current study uses the exchange rate as a control variable along with foreign purchases and sales to strengthen the explanatory ability of the model.  The previous literature shows there is a significant relationship between foreign portfolio investment and stock market measures in different contexts. Some scholars argue that foreign portfolio investment has a positive impact on the stock market (Yarty, 2008; Patro & Wald, 2005; Kim & Singal, 2000; Wurgler, 2000; Raghuram & Zingales, 1998) while several other scholars state negative or no relationship between the two variables (Gorg & Strobl, 2004; Koskei, 2017). Most of the reviewed literature considered stock market as a whole despite thin and thick transactions in respective trading sectors. Thus, the researcher identifies this elimination of sectoral specifications as a gap in the prevailing literature. Moreover, studies conducted on the impact of FPI on the CSE are inconclusive. Therefore, this study attempts to fill the existing literature gap.  4. Data and Sample Period The study used secondary data to measure the variables; foreign purchases, foreign sales, exchange rate (LKR/USD) and sector indices gathered from the CSE data library and Federal Reserve Economic data sources. The sample period was eleven years; from 2007 to 2017 and monthly data was deployed for the purpose. Sectors IT, Oil Palms, Stores Supplies and Services were eliminated due to thin trading issues. The selected 16 sectors, namely; Banking, Finance and Insurance (BFI), Beverage, Food and Tobacco (BFT), ", "123": " \n119  Construction and Engineering (C&E), Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals (C&P), Diversified Holdings (DIV), Footwear and Textiles (F&T), Healthcare (HLT), Hotels and Travels (H&T), Investment Trusts (INV), Land and Property (L&P), Manufacturing (MFG), Motors (MTR), Plantation (PLT), Power and Energy (P&E), Telecommunication (TLE) and Trading (TRD).  5. Description of Variables  After rigorous theoretical and empirical review, the explanatory variables for the study have been selected. As the proxy in measuring the portfolio performance, the monthly Foreign Portfolio Purchases and Foreign Portfolio Sales are used. For the purpose of measuring the sector performance, monthly Sector Indices are used. The Foreign Portfolio Purchases and Foreign Portfolio Sales are identified to the model based on the conceptual model developed by Koskei, (2017) and Ali & Hussain, (2013). To satisfy the nonspurious results Exchange Rate is used as a control variable. The study uses the directly quoted exchange rate which is LKR/USD as the control variable. Despite Euro and other currencies, the research selected the USD exchange rate provided the USA is the largest foreign portfolio investor base in the world as well in Sri Lanka.  6. The Models  The study used a common model (1) which will be altered to separate sector variables as given below; ttttLNEXSLUSLNSLNPLNSItHEEEE++\u2212+=3210         (1) Where, LNSI   Natural Logarithm of Monthly Sector Stock Index LNP   Natural Logarithm of Monthly Sector Foreign Portfolio Purchases LNS   Natural Logarithm of Monthly Sector Foreign Portfolio Sales  LNEXSLUS  Natural Logarithm of Monthly Exchange Rate (LKR/USD)   \u03b20   Intercept \u03b5t   Error Term In order to develop the fitted model for the time series, the unit root test used is the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test.

The procedure is consistent with Pesaran et al. (2001) who incorporated I(0) and I(1) variables in the same estimation. There are several pre-conditions to be satisfied in order to run ARDL model. One of the key conditions is that none of the variables should be stationary at I(2) or in an above level in normal conditions. Several previous researchers have used ARDL model in their methodology such as Kumara & Dayaratne (2015) and Garg & Dua (2014). The long-run equation (3) is as follows; tttttLNEXSLUSLNSLNPLNSIHEEEE++++=3210              (3) The Error Correction Model (ECM) is used to estimate the short-run dynamics of each time series as both conditions negativity and significance of coefficients satisfy in the test. Thus, the ECM is used to forecast the speed of restoring back to the equilibrium in short-run during disequilibrium in system. The estimation of short-run coefficients is carried out using the equation (4) given below; tttttECTLNEXSLUSCLNSCLNPCCLNSIHI++'+'+'+='\u221213210        (4) Where,  C1, C2, C3 Short-run coefficients ECT  Error correction term \u00d8  Speed of adjustment 7. Results and Discussion  The results of the ADF test are summarized in Table 1. It shows that the variables are stationary in the I(0) or in I(1) which suggests that , all the data series in the model are not integrated in the same order. Further, none of the variables is integrated at I(2) or in an ", "125": "121  above level. Interestingly, the stationary test satisfies the pre-requisite for applying the ARDL model.

The findings suggest that C&E, HLT, INV, L&P, MFG, MTR and TRD sectors do not show any long-run relationship in the independent and dependent variables. It means that selected variables are not co-integrated in those sectors. Foreign portfolio purchases have a positive long-run relationship with sector index in some sectors namely; BFI, BFT, DIV, F&T, PLT and TLE while short-run relationship is shown only in BFI sector. When carefully analyzing the degree of impact from foreign purchases only BFI, BFT and DIV sectors show above 0.5% impact while BFT is 0.92%. These are the sectors recognized under MSCI frontier market index: Commercial Bank \u2013 BFI, Ceylon Tobacco \u2013 BFT and John Keells Holdings \u2013 DIV. The results suggest that foreign purchases have a high impact on those sectors. It provides evidence to agree with the fact that foreign investors are interested in investing in high market capitalization companies. Even though the literature does not provide evidence to prove by the same sector analysis, the long-run positive relationship of foreign portfolio purchases towards sector index is consistent with Halale (2014) and Ali & Hussain (2013). When considering the foreign portfolio sales, the general expectation is that the capital outflow would have a negative impact on the stock index. - Ex NA - DIV - P - S - Ex Yes  + NA NA  NA NA NA F&T - P - S - Ex Yes  + + +  NA NA NA H&T - P - S - Ex Yes  NA + +  NA NA NA PLT - P - S - Ex Yes  + + +  NA + NA P&E - P - S - Ex Yes  NA + +  NA + NA TLE - P - S - Ex Yes  + NA NA  NA NA NA ", "128": " \n124  However, the results show a long-run positive relationship in sectors: F&T, H&T, PLT and P&E. Further, PLT and P&E show both long-run and short-run positive relationships. The foreign investors are considered to be more analytical and tactful than the local investors. Dornbusch & Park (1995) stated that foreign investors develop a tendency to acquire securities when the prices are rising and sell when the prices start to fall. Hence, when the foreigners sell the shares, the domestic investors would assume those shares are still profitable and willing to purchase. Therefore, it is expected the negative impact from foreign sales would be overcome by the domestic purchasing and it will result for upturn in sector index. A close look to results state that the positive impact gained from domestic purchases is higher than that of the negative impact of foreign sales. However, this significant positive relationship is contradictory to the study conducted by Koskei (2017).  Furthermore, exchange rate (LKR/USD) shows a positive relationship with stock index and it is a long-run positive relationship in F&T, H&T, PLT and P&E sectors. Since the researcher considered direct quotation of exchange rate, an increase means depreciation in local currency. The, depreciation in local currency would increase the monetary value of the aggregate demand of the aforementioned sectors and increase their future cash flows. As theory states, this will cause for the increase in the share price. Interestingly, the only short-run relationship is with C&P sector and it is negative (-1.27).  The C&P sector is more into imports since most chemical and pharmaceutical products are not manufactured or discovered in Sri Lanka. Possible explanation is that, during the depreciation of local currency, the cost of imports will go up, resulting in a downturn in the profitability and performance of the sector. The results consistent with Ma & Kao (1990) found that a currency appreciation negatively effects on the domestic stock market for an export-dominant country and positively affects the domestic stock market for an import-dominant country.  8. Conclusion This paper examines the relationship between FPI and sectoral performance with the exchange rate used as a control variable. Since the stock market tends to be highly sensitive and volatile, the study examines monthly data to capture short-run dynamics. The results indicate that the relationship between foreign portfolio purchases and sector index is positive as expected in Price Pressure Hypothesis theory. However, the relationship between foreign portfolio sales and stock index is positive, contrary to the theoretical ", "129": " \n125  framework established in the paper. According to the findings, an increase in the exchange rate (LKR/USD) positively impacts the sector index of export-oriented sectors while it has a negative impact on the import-oriented sectors. As an increase in the exchange rate means the depreciation of local currency, the finding corroborates the Flow-oriented Theory, which relates depreciation in domestic currency causes an increase in the share price. The most sensitive finding is that all the sectors response to FPI in varying degrees. Hence, any policy directives should focus on selected sectors rather than the entire market.

Managing liquidity risk will be a good practice to maintain a higher level of profitability. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of liquidity risk on the bank profitability of commercial banks in Sri Lanka, considering the sample period from 2009 to 2018. Liquidity risk was measured by using the current ratio, capital adequacy ratio, liquid assets to total assets ratio, equity to total assets ratio and the number of deposits while bank profitability was measured by using return on assets. 11 local commercial banks were selected for the sample. Secondary data were collected from the published annual reports of selected banks. Correlation coefficient and panel data regression analysis were used to analyze the data. The study found that the current ratio and the number of deposits significantly influence bank profitability. The current ratio showed a positive relationship and  the number of deposits has a negative relationship with the profitability. Further, there is no significant impact of liquid assets to the total assets ratio, equity to total assets ratio and capital adequacy ratio to return on assets.  Keywords: Bank Profitability, Commercial Banks, Liquidity Risk. 1. Introduction  In the present, financial crisis affect the economic conditions of many countries in the world. This situation can be seen in a considerable number of developing countries and developed countries (Ajao & Obida, 2012). As a result of financial crisis, most of the industries in the world collapsed such as World Bank, International Monetary Fund (Ajao & Obida, 2012). Thus, after the crisis, the liquidity concept is considered as the most important factor in the economy.  ", "133": " \n129  Due to the effects of the financial crisis, financial sector directly faced the worst situations. Banks are the main part of the financial sector in any economy. The banking sector in Sri Lanka is very important to the growth of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) through better credit quality and increase in investments including Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) through developments of infrastructure projects. In 2017 the GDP growth contribution of the banking sector was 3.8%, 4%, and 3.3% respectively in the first , second & the third quarters . During the first quarter of the year 2018, they expected to maintain 5% contribution to the GDP rate. (Lokugamage & Weerasinghe, 2017) In Sri Lanka, the main regulatory body of the banks is the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). There are 26 commercial banks currently operating through a total of 1,711 branches and other banking outlets in the country under the CBSL. The main duties of banks are accepting customers\u2019 deposits and issuing credit facilities for their clients. Therefore, banks tent to earn more profit through accepting a large amount of customer deposits, investing in long term bonds, issuing long term lending and providing other financial services. When doing those functions in the banking industry, banks face some sort of risks that influence  their profitability and the sustainability. Shen, et al. (2018) point out that the future of the banking industry will be more likely to suffer from the liquidity problem due to the dependence on the short term money market and the purchased fund market. Therefore, banks must maintain proper risk mitigation tools to face those risks arise in banking sector such as operational risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, market risk, and interest rate risk etc. Otherwise, it may cause a failure to the whole financial system which will impact on the GDP too (Shama, Muhammad & Khizer, 2011).  In order to gain an insight and understand the relationship, if any, between liquidity risk and profitability in commercial banks in Sri Lanka, the main objective is set. That is to investigate the influence of liquidity risk on commercial banks\u2019 performance in Sri Lanka & to discover the highly impacted factor on liquidity risk.  The banks in the economy have a responsibility to maintain a risk management system to reduce losses. Among those risks, credit risk and liquidity risk  highly influence on the bank performance because those risks may cause a negative impact with bank performance.   ", "134": " \n130  Liquidity risk is a risk arising from a bank\u2019s inability to meet its obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses (Comptroller of the Currency, 2001). Banks must hold a considerable position in liquid assets while on the other hand, they are required to be profitable for them to be sustainable. The banks tend to earn more profit by giving long term loans. They fund their money in profitable bonds with a higher risk and banks desire high profits for their clients. Helder, Delio, & Renato (2011) said these type of procedures can be highly risky when providing the financial services because they directly influence to the whole economy. Distress in one bank may cause to happen contagion effect in the whole banking industry (Lahiru & Manjula, 2014).  To reduce the liquidity risk, banks have to monitor the various liquidity ratios and taggers like stress testing to gauge the bank\u2019s capacity to handle liquidity shocks and monitoring of the liquidity ratios. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2013) introduce the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for this purpose. The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. The regulatory parties have taken various actions to mitigate those risks and reduce the potential financial losses. But the important thing is that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2013) says the beginning of the 2007, beginning of the financial crisis, many banks despite adequate capital levels, still experienced difficulties because they did not manage their liquidity in a prudent manner. As a recent incident, the United States Subprime crisis was the latest financial and economic crisis which impacted to Sri Lanka. Some registered and non-registered finance companies in Sri Lanka faced difficulties in 2008. As well as, we have some of the experiences before the year 2008 as well. Derana Bank PLC Failure Derana bank was a licensed commercial bank under the supervision of Central Bank which was establish in 1979. They had a fundamental problem with finances of the bank as well as liquidity problems. According to the liquidity problem faced in 2009, Derana bank faced panic among the customers. A construction company took advantages of the government contacts to obtain scarce bank capital from state controlled banks. Bank, without a feasibility study and without the collateral for the loans, given it to the company. As a main creditor of the Derana bank, collapse of that construction company created a liquidity problem for Derana bank. The Deana bank was collapsed due to that liquidity problem.  ", "135": " \n131  Pramukha Bank Failure  According to the Charted Accounts of Sri Lanka (2010), the Pramukha savings & development bank was one of the specialized saving banks, which had an employee strength of 160 personnel with more than 15,000 accounts. They approached poor villagers through established agencies at village level to grant credit facilities. Within the first five years the Pramuka bank exceeded 3,700 million worth of savings. In October, 2002 Pramukha bank collapsed due to bad debts amounting to Rs. 2.2 Billion. The Non-Performing Assets (NPA) amounted to Rs. 1.27 Billion and the NPA ratio which was initially at 25% has risen to 50% overnight and at the time of collapse it was 80%. As a result of negative \u2018net-worth\u201d, the central bank of Sri Lanka confirmed their loss as Rs. 419.7 Million in 2002. Finally, the Pramukha bank  collapsed due to those bad debts. The Charted Accounts of Sri Lanka (2010) specially mentioned there, Pramukha bank was unable to maintain the minimum statutory liquid assets ratio of 20% at that period. However, the bank had not been able to raise enough equity capital along with its expansion. The capital adequacy ratio of the bank has remained slightly below that of the other leading commercial banks (Lahiru & Manjula, 2014).  Financial Crisis in 2008  Hemachandra (2012) identified that under the subprime crisis in US, the liquidity problem was impacted to some of the domestic banks (e.g. Seylan Bank) and some finance companies. Apart from the Seylan bank, Golden Key Credit Card Company Ltd and Sakwithi House Construction (pvt) Ltd and finance companies affiliated to the Ceylinco group also collapsed.  Seylan Bank Failure  In 2008, Seylan bank was the 6th largest commercial bank in Sri Lanka and faced a deposit run towards the end of December 2008 due to the Subprime crisis. The reasons of the failure of Seylan Bank are some unauthorized deposit acceptors failed to honor their commitments towards depositors in the midst and their poor financial management. As a systematically important bank in Sri Lanka, the Seylan Bank PLC faced sudden distress due to liquidity problem. None of the commercial banks had suffered a similar situation in the past. Lahiru & Manjula (2014) said that the Seylan bank distress was directly linked with US Subprime crisis. Expecting contagion effect, larger scale of Sri Lankan depositors ", "136": " \n132  had placed their money and investors also withdraw their savings with these financial institutions despite the warnings issued by the CBSL.  Edirisinghe Trust Investment (ETI) Failure   ETI Finance under the ownership of the EAP group worked as a nonbanking financial Institution. In 2018 ETI Finance was to be liquated due to bankruptcy. Until 30th of September 2018, the ETI depositors informed to make their payments. There were over 25,000 depositors at that time & these depositors estimated as the total sum of deposits amount to approximately 36 b billion rupees. According to further investigation, ETI was collapsing recently because of inability to pay their customers around 36 billion rupees. ETI company\u2019s financial accounts for the year ended March 2012 showed a lower capital adequacy ratio and lower liquid assets than to the company standard minimum requirements. In 2018, they could not repay Rs. 36 billion for the depositors even if they sell their all the assets of ETI Company which is amounting to Rs. 15 billion.  The necessity of liquidity management in a bank was arisen after those incidents. Managing sufficient liquid means, banks have to tie up in liquid assets. Some of the banks tend to earn more profit by investing their liquid position in long term lending, long term investments  accepting higher risks. To restrict this kind of situations, as the main regulatory party,the CBSL has introduced rules and regulations to mitigate the liquidity risk and reduce the potential financial losses due to the lack of liquidity. After the financial crisis in 2008, the necessity of liquidity risk was arisen. The liquidity risk affects both the performance and the reputation of banks. Every bank needs to balance their liquidity position under the CBSL warnings and otherwise they may have to face distress situations. Thus, it is important for the banks to strengthen liquidity risk management, and liquidity risk will be an important issue in the future. It is expected to read out the research problem as,  What is the impact of liquidity risk on profitability of the commercial banks in Sri Lanka?  As a developing country, Sri Lanka pays more attention to the service sector because of higher development and higher contribution to the GDP (Lokugamage & Weerasinghe, 2017). Finance sector, as a major sub sector to the service sector, plays a vital role with the banks as their main players. Banks are very important to the economy. But the risks arising related to the banking sector are higher than the other financial institutions. Liquidity ", "137": " \n133  management becomes a very important part in financial management decisions, where the liquidity management efficiency could be achieved by firms that manage a trade-off between liquidity and profitability (Bhunia & Khan, 2011). Thus, every bank manager must give a priority to manage liquidity risk. The findings of the research will be helpful to bank managers and shareholders of the financial companies to take efficient financing decisions. As well as, it can be used to predict possible risks that may be occurred in future, and they can get prior decisions to minimize the risks arising from bank activities.  2. Literature Review  There are various definitions for the liquidity risk. The simple meaning of the liquidity risk is inability of converting assets in to cash quickly at the lowest possible cost at the time itself. When analyzing the previous research articles, more definitions and concepts can be identified relating to the liquidity. A bank may lose the confidence of its depositors if funds are not timely provided to them. The bank\u2019s reputation may become at stake in this situation. In addition to this, a poor liquidity position may cause penalties from the regulator. Therefore, it becomes imperative for a bank to keep a sound liquidity arrangement. Liquidity risk has become a serious concern and challenge for the modern era banks (Comptroller of the currency, 2001)  Garson (2001) mentioned that the liquidity risk has become the most challengeable concept for the banks in the modern era. The importance of liquidity risk is emphasized due to the world subprime crisis from 2007 to 2008. Basel Committee (2015) asserts that fundamental role of banks in the transformation of short-term deposits into long-term loans makes banks vulnerable to liquidity risk, a liquidity shortfall at a single bank can have system-wide repercussions. After the global sub-prime crisis of 2007 to 2008, the importance of liquidity management in banking sector was emphasized. According to Demirguc et al (2010), the banks should highly consider their creditworthiness, because controlling liquidity risk is a difficult thing when developing guiding principles to mitigate the liquidity problems of banks. As well as banks must consider the stressful market conditions, managing price and interest rates. While having this kind of a difficult situation, banks have less flexibility. Derivatives and hedge the banks\u2019 position are required to access the financial markets. A bank\u2019s liquidity control methods are determined by its ability to access future markets.  ", "138": " \n134  Within a short period of time, liquidity crisis can be developed to a capitalization crisis. The crisis can be avoided by the bank itself by using liquidity ratios such as liquidity coverage ratio, capital adequacy ratio, liquid assets to total assets ratio and maintaining the other liquidity requirements that are announced by the CBSL. On the other hand, holding a large amount of liquid assets may develop the maturity transformation and funding risk. Because of these, liquid assets can be sold or pledged (Goodhart, 2008). To mitigate the liquidity risk, anybody can decide to hold a large amount of most liquid assets in hand to meet customer requirements and minimize the liquidity risk, but it may cost highly. Furthermore, the CBSL announces the statutory requirements that banks have to maintain to face the outcomes of future liquidity problems. A bank always tries to avoid the capital injection from the government because this may place a given bank at the government\u2019s mercy (Jeanne & Svennsson, 2007). Therefore, banks hold minimum cash balance to avoid liquidity problems (Jenkinson, 2008).  Profit is very important for all businesses, because the survival depends on this factor. Profitability plays as a major tool in measuring the management efficiency in the use of organizational resources by adding value to the business firm. Ajao & Obida (2012) mentioned that a company should earn profit to ensure the survival and growth over a long period of time. Further, they mentioned that the profit is essential, but all management decisions should not be profit centered. There are several ratios that can be used for evaluating the profitability of a business like return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).The ROA is selected to measure the profitability for this analysis which measures the corporate performance of a bank. Potential investors focus on the profitability ratios as they are interested in dividends and appreciation in share prices (Ajanthan, 2013).  Liquidity ratios determine the ability of a firm to generate the cash flow in the year and compared it with short term obligations. This  provides a clear picture if the firm has a problem related to the short term debt paying ability (Saleem & Rehman, 2011).  Current ratio is the most common and oldest measure of cooperate liquidity (Lamburg & Valming, 2009). From this ratio, it can be measured the ability of covering current liabilities by using current assets. As a benchmark, companies keep value of 2:1 for current ratio. It means, companies need to hold twice of the current assets value as the current liabilities.  ", "139": " \n135  Capital adequacy ratio is taken as a measure of the bank\u2019s capital level and also relation to its risk which included in loans, advances and investments in securities so on. Mostly, capital adequacy ratio is used to measure the bank\u2019s ability to withstand the risk measured by the bank. The bank\u2019s higher capital adequacy ratio than the Central Bank minimum requirement means risky. However, the bank must maintain an acceptable ratio. The bank must be aware of the need to strengthen its Tier I capital and is working with a range of possible alternatives to improve this critical ratio (BOC Annual Report 2018).  Furthermore, the capital adequacy ratio is used to measure the financial strength and the adequacy of bank\u2019s capital. Currently acceptable minimum ratio is 10%. This is a significant ratio that is known as capital to risk assets ratio.  The researcher uses the ratio of Equity to Total Assets (ETA) to express the capital strength of banks held. High equity to assets ratio means that the bank is safer than the others from problem of liquidation. Capital of the bank increases means the expected earnings may rise due to reducing the expected cost of financial distress (Berger, 1995). The lower risk of the banks increases the creditworthiness as well as reduces the cost of funding consequently. Past researchers used equity to total assets ratio as an explanatory variable. Demirg\u00fc\u00e7 & Huizinga, (2010) found positive relationship between equity to total assets ratio and profitability. Thus bank have to maintain a higher equity to total assets ratio to minimize the liquidity risk and increase the profits. If a bank has a higher equity to assets ratio, it will have lower needs of external funding and therefore bank can earn higher profitability. Increase in cash reserves decreases the earnings of the bank. One of the prime causes of liquidity risk is the maturity mismatch between the assets and liabilities. In the banking business, the majority of the assets are funded with deposits most of which are current with a possibility to be called at any time. This situation is known as the mismatch between assets and liabilities (CBSL, 2008). Banks use deposit as a natural hedge against the liquidity risk (Gatev & Strahan, 2003). The fund inflows to the banks act as a natural hedge in banks to bank\u2019s outflows due to loans. Therefore, the deposits can be used as a hedge to minimize the liquidity risk.     ", "140": " \n136  Liquidity Risk Vs. Profitability  The past researches revealed that liquidity levels significantly affect the bank\u2019s profitability. This is consistent with Dang (2011) who found that adequate level of liquidity is positively related with bank profitability. Shen, et.al (2018) found the liquidity risk as the endogenous determinant of performance of the banks. The causes of liquidity risk include components of liquid assets and dependence on external funding, supervisory and regulatory factors and macroeconomic factors. Besides, they also found that liquidity risk may lower the bank profitability with negative relationship.  Furthermore, previous empirical evidence showed that the effect of liquidity risk on bank profitability is mixed. Some studies like Molyneux & Thornton (1992) who found out the positive effect between liquidity risk and profitability. Others found out the negative effect (Boruke, 1989; and Demirg\u00fc\u00e7 & Levine, 1999).  Referring to the previous empirical studies, it has been identified the following key highlights. Mamatzakis & Bermpei (2014) examined the impact of liquidity risk by using 97 of sample banks in Switzerland. The result showed negative impact with bank performance. The Iranian study investigated by Tabari, Ahmadi and Emami (2013) who used a seven years\u2019 time period to study the effect of liquidity risk on bank performance in Iranian commercial banks. The main results indicate that, besides the negative effect of liquidity risk on performance of Iranian banks. Ariff and Anees (2012) investigated the impact of liquidity risk on bank profitability on 22 Pakistani banks over the period 2004-2009, Results show that bank performance is negatively and significantly correlated with the liquidity risk. On the other hand, Latary, Antwi, & Boadi (2013) in Ghana who analyzed the relation between liquidity and profitability by using seven listed banks during the period 2005-2010 found that there is a weak positive effect of liquidity on bank profitability. Boruke (1989) also showed a positive relationship of his study between the liquidity risk and bank performance. He used a sample of 13 banks during the period 2004-2012.  3. Methodology  Pearson Correlation analysis and Panel Data Regression analysis were used to analyze the collected data as the main two methodological tools.    ", "141": " \n137  Conceptual Framework  The dependent variable of the study is Return on assets (ROA). As independent variables liquid assets to total assets ratio, current ratio, capital adequacy ratio, equity to total assets ratio and number of deposits are used.  Independent Variables           Dependent Variable  Liquidity Risk           Bank Performance              Figure 1: Conceptual framework  Source: (Shen, et al ,2012)  Return on Assets (ROA)  Return on Assets ratio is a profitability ratio that calculates the net income as a percentage of the total assets held by the bank at the end of the financial year. If a bank has higher amount of assets that means a bank should be able to earn higher amount of income.The ROA can be calculated by dividing  the net income plus interest expenses by bank\u2019s assets during the year and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.  Current Ratio  Current ratio represents the ability of covering current liabilities by using current assets. As a benchmark, companies keep value of 2:1 for current ratio. Thus, companies must hold twice of the current assets value than current liabilities (Maness & Zietlow, 2005). Higher value of the current ratio provides a good picture for the relationship between current assets and liabilities because  all the current assets and current liabilities are included in this ratio. The current ratio is the most important one to make favorable decisions for the interested parties. Bank managers can investigate the present and potential financial strength through the current ratio. The short term debt paying ability, the requirement of changing policies relating to the debtors, creditors, inventories and other bank activities related to current ratio provide a good indication to the bank and it may help to increase the bank performance \nLiquid Assets to Total Assets Ratio \nCurrent Ratio  \nCapital Adequacy Ratio  \nEquity to Total Assets Ratio  \nNumber of Deposits  \n ROA  ", "142": " \n138  through the proper management of current assets and current liabilities. Current ratio measures the liquidity of a company that reveals whether a company has enough short term assets to meet their short term liabilities.  Current Ratio    =  Current Assets  Current Liabilities   Capital Adequacy Ratio  The capital adequacy ratio is considered as a measurement of a bank\u2019 risk, insolvency from excessive losses. Another way, it can be identified as capital to risk assets ratio. It has a direct relationship with statutory capital requirements. The acceptable value of capital adequacy ratio is 8% in the present. The banks have to maintain a comfortable CAR level according to the statutory requirements of the CBSL.  Capital Adequacy Ratio = (Tier 1 capital + Tier 2 capital)  Risk weighted Assets   Liquid Assets to Total Assets Ratio  If banks hold much more liquid assets, it means that the net interest margin of the banks may be low. It directly influences the bank profitability. The reason for the low interest margin is lower return of holding assets without investing. Thus, all bank managers should diversify their funding sources to manage the liquidity risk properly. For this reason, the researcher uses this ratio to assess the liquidity risk. It can calculate by dividing liquid assets in to total assets.  Liquid Assets to Total Assets Ratio =    Liquid Assets        Total Assets   Equity to Total Assets Ratio  Higher equity to total assets ratio of a bank is considered as safer in the occasion of liquidation. High capital of a bank may increase the expected earnings by reducing the expected cost of financial distress. If a bank has low liquidity risk, it may increase the creditworthiness (Berger, 1995). Equity to total assets ratio represents the company\u2019s assets on which shareholder\u2019s equity. The necessary figures are taken from the company balance sheet to calculate the ratio.  Equity to total assets ratio =   Shareholder\u2019s equity        Total assets  ", "143": " \n139  Number of deposits  Deposits play a vital role in the banking sector because they increase the bank\u2019s profitability. Deposits can be identified as the main pillar of the industry. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the number of deposits and the profitability of banks. If depositors withdraw their deposits from banks, it creates a liquidity trap in a bank (Jeanne & Svennsson, 2007). There are two types of bank deposits like demand deposits and savings deposits. Most of the banking activities run through deposits of the bank.  Data and Data Collection method  To meet the intended outcomes of the research, audited financial statements from 2009 to 2018 of each bank was used to estimate the profitability and the liquidity risk.  Data Analysis Tools Pearson correlation coefficients were used to identify the association between selected variables and regression analysis was used to identify the relationship between independent and dependent variables.  Panel data analysis is a statistical method which is used to analyze two dimensional panel data. Panel data are also called cross-sectional time-series data. These data have observations on the same units in different time periods. Panel data may have individual effect, time effect, or both which are analyzed by using fixed effect model, random effect model or pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. Among the three models, to find the right model, the researcher applied F test, Breusch and Pega\u2019s Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test and Hausman test. To compare pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) model and the fixed effect model, the F test is used. To compare the fixed effect model and random effect model, the Hausman test is performed. If the findings are statistically significant, the fixed effect model will be used, or else random effect model is appropriate. To test random effect and pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model it is performed the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test. If the findings are statistically significant, random effect model will be used or else fixed effect model is appropriate. If the null hypothesis is not rejected in both the  tests, the pooled OLS regression is most appropriate.

If  the individual effects such as cross sectional or time effect does not exist, ordinary least squares (OLS) produce efficient and consistent parameters. As the pooled regression model neglects the heterogeneity across the individuals and further assume that the same coefficient for all individuals, those effects are unique to each individual included in the error term. The basic model of pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression can be developed as follows,  Yit = \u03b20 + \u03b21X1it +\u2026+ \u03b2kXkit + \u03b5it  Where,  \u2013 Yit is the dependent variable (DV) where i = entity and t = time  \u2013Xit - Xkit represents independent variables (IV) where i= entity and t = time  \u2013 \u03b21 - \u03b2k is the coefficients of independent variables  \u2013 \u03b20 is the constant of independent variables  \u2013 \u03b5 is the error term  Fixed Effect (FE) Model  Fixed effect model assumes that the time-invariant factors are unique to the individual and it may not be correlated with other individual factors. Thus, FE model controls the time-invariant differences between each entity. Every individual unit is different from each unit. Thus, the entity\u2019s error term and constant should not be correlated with the predictors. Thus, the fixed effect model applies when the error terms are not correlated.

Data Presentation and Analysis  For this study, several statistical methods have been used to analyze the data that have been collected from 11 local commercial banks on the profitability as well as liquidity risk. Gathered data were analyzed by using Pearson Correlation and Panel Data Regression method with the support of STATA software. And also the researcher has used descriptive statistics to describe the behavior of the variables in the study. Behavior of the Variables  Behavior of ROA  The ROA is a measure of the bank\u2019s profitability which identifies the net income of the bank on total assets of the bank during a period of time. This Return on Assets ratio shows how a bank has earned profits against  its total assets over time. Stakeholders use the ratio not only to evaluate whether the bank has considerable profits, but also to assess whether the bank has higher returns according to the assets. Mostly, investors use this ratio to see how the profitability of the bank to invest their money is. \n Figure 2: Return on Assets Ratio  Source: Based on annual reports of banking sector   When considering the year 2015 DFCC recorded the highest value of the ROA amounting to 4.5 while the 0.6 recorded as the lowest amount in the year 2018 in this bank during these ten years of time period. It is highlighted that in 2013 HNB has the highest ROA as 4. It shows an abnormal increase. UNION bank has the lowest values for ROA ranging from 1.1 to 0.6. Generally HNB, Commercial bank, Sampath bank, Pan Asia Bank, Peoples\u2019Bank, Seylan bank & NDB recorded a sharply stable amount of ROA during the ten years.   \n", "147": "143  Behavior of Current Ratio  \n Figure 3: Current Ratio  Source: Based on annual reports of Commercial banks   When considering the current ratio of above banks, there are so many highlighting points.

During these time period, it can be seen many more fluctuations of this ratio. Most of the banks do not maintain stable amount of this ratio while less number of banks could maintain. Banks like DFCC, Union, NTB, NDB and PAB couldn\u2019t maintain a stable amount of this ratio. The lowest amount reported in Union Bank was 2.01 in 2013.

This showed Sri Lankan commercial banks maintain moderate level of current ratio with mean value of 0.9. Variability of current ratio among commercial banks during the study period as shown by their standard deviation values 0.8%.  Minimum value of the Capital adequacy ratio is 6.6. It indicates that there are some banks which are poorly capitalized, while the maximum is representing as 40.9. The mean value of it amounted to 15.3.

According to the results, current ratio and liquid assets to total assets ratio have a positive coefficient with ROA, under the pooled OLS model. As well as capital adequacy ratio, equity to total assets and number of deposits have a negative coefficient with ROA.  The fixed effect model is significant and the ability to influence the profitability of the bank is (Prob > F 0.0000). Furthermore, the researcher has considered the R2 value. The value of R2 in fixed effect model is 0.248. The R2 value has been used to determine the amount of variance in the dependent variable which is explained by all the variables in the formula. The F test is used often when statistical model which has been fitted to a data set are comparing, with the purpose of identifying the model which is the best fitted to the population where the sample is taken. In the above test already the fixed effect model is better than the pooled OLS model. Prob > F is 0.0000. Therefore, the fixed effect model is selected as it is better than the OLS for return on assets.  FE explores the relationship between predictor and outcome variables within a bank. Each bank has its own individual characteristics that may or may not influence the predictor variables. When using FE, we assume that something within the individual may impact or bias the predictor or outcome variables and we need to control this. This is the rationale behind the assumption of the correlation between entity\u2019s error term and predictor variables. FE removes the effect of those time-invariant characteristics so that we can assess the net effect of the predictors on the outcome variable. Based on that information fixed effect model is fitted better than the OLS.  Random effect model is significant and has the ability to influence the profitability of the bank. Furthermore, the researcher considers the R2 value. Value of R2 in random effect model is 0.404. It denotes a higher value than R-squared in fixed effect model. Therefore, it can be argued that the best model among OLS and random effect model is random effect model.  Breusch and Pegan\u2019s Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test is used to select the most fitted model among OLS and random effect model. Null hypothesis of the LM test is the Pooled OLS model which is not appropriate and alternative hypothesis is the random effect model which is appropriate.

To identify the most suitable model between random effect model and fixed effect model, Hausman test is used. According to the results of Hausman test, random effect model is the most fitted model because the p value of chi2 is higher than 0.05 (Prob>chi2 = 0.9909).    The equation for the random effects model becomes:  Yit = \u03b21Xit + \u03b1i + uit  ROAit = \u03b1i + \u03b21 CRit - \u03b22 LNNDit + uit + \u03b5it  The result of random effect model as presented in table 5, the study proves that the current ratio significantly impacts on bank profitability with 0.5047 coefficient. This results support to conclude that, CR has significant positive impact on bank profitability with ROA. Nevertheless, CAR, LATA, ETA showed as influential variables when determining the bank profitability. ROA and LNND have a significant negative impact with the bank profitability. The p value is 0.015 which is also less than the recommended level of 0.05, hence, it  is able to express that the number of deposits impact on the bank profitability.  P value of the capital adequacy ratio is 0.071 which indicates that CAR does not impact on ROA of commercial banks in Sri Lanka. The liquid assets to total assets ratio with 0.096 significant level which is greater than 0.05. There is an insignificant impact caused with ROA. The p value of equity to total assets ratio is 0.948 since the p-value of ETA is higher than 0.05, there is no any impact between ETA and ROA  5. Discussion  It is focused on the outcome of the research in more critical way by discussing the original aims of the research in combination with the past researches which have tested the similar type of relationships of profitability with different variables. In addition to that, the explanations on implications on the significant values and insignificant values of research outcome will be elaborated based on the research outcome and information on empirical evidence of the prior researches. The result of panel data regression analysis implies that there is a significant positive relationship between current ratio and profitability of banks. This means that the higher the ratio of liquidity risk, higher the profitability position in the bank. The parameter value indicates that 1% increase in current ratio increases ROA by ", "154": " \n150  0.5047%. And also there is a significant negative relationship between the number of deposits and profitability of banks. This means that the higher the amount of deposits handle by banks, lower the profitability position in the bank. The parameter value indicates that 1% increase in number of deposits decreases ROA by 0.1803%.  Liquidity risk is considered as an important financial stability indicator (Lamburg & Valming, 2009). If it happens any liquidity shortfall in one bank, it may influence to a systematic crisis in the whole banking industry due to the interconnected network of all the banks in an economy (Shen, Chen, Kao, & Yeh, 2018). The liquidity risk for commercial banks in Kenya was significant and this could be attributed to increase in liquidity of commercial banks in Kenya as per the Central Bank regulations (Maniagi, et al, 2017). The results of the article of Liquidity risk and performance of banking system of Arif, & Anees (2012) show a significant relationship between Liquidity risk and the Bank profitability. The other study of Shen, et al. (2018) represented that liquidity risk as an endogenous determinant of bank performance. They express the components of the liquidity risk like liquid assets and dependence on external funding, supervisory and regulatory factors and macroeconomic factors. Besides, they also found that liquidity risk may lower the bank return on assets and return on equity. Maaka (2013) investigated the relationship between liquidity risk and financial performances of commercial banks in Kenya in his unpublished thesis by using panel data of 33 Kenyan banks for the period 2008 to 2012, the results had significant negative results to performance. In a similar research done in Kenya by Mwangi (2014) for the period 2010 to 2013 and selected 43 commercial banks  found that the asset quality and banks to total Assets as proxies of liquidity were negatively correlated to performance at 99% confidence level. However findings of Maniagi, Clive, Mbithi, & Tobias (2017)  showed positive and significant relationship with bank performance.  The results that are reported by Marozva (2015) in his article, showed a significant negative relationship between net interest margin and funding liquidity risk. On the other findings interpreted, there are insignificant relationships between net interest margin and market liquidity by Maudos and Solis (2009).    ", "155": " \n151  Finally, this study showed only two significant variables with return on assets of banks. Rest of the three variables are insignificant with the dependent variable. Thus, as a conclusion, it is found that there is no significant impact among ROA and the liquidity risk. The liquidity risk may not highly influence on the bank profitability.  6. Conclusion  The concept of liquidity risk management is a very important factor that banks have to pay prioritized concern for daily the operations of the banks. But still the banking sector do not pay a considerable attention to avoid the liquidity risk. All  the financial institutions and banks try to earn more profit taking a higher risk. However, the findings of the empirical studies have generated varying evidences that will lead this topic to a debatable condition. Majority of the researches have been carried out in the developed countries and when it comes to the Sri Lankan context, there is a huge necessity for doing this type of researches as well as it is very important to minimize the future liquidity problems.  With the statistical evidence, the paper shows that there is a relationship between return on assets and other independent variables such current ratio, liquid assets to total assets ratio and equity to total assets ratio have positive relationship. The model, which was estimated for the period of 2009 to 2018, explained ROA and the other independent variables with the 95% of confident level. The main objective of the research is to investigate the influence of liquidity risk on commercial banks\u2019 profitability in Sri Lanka & to discover the highly impacted factor on liquidity risk. According to the findings of specification tests, random effect model is selected as the best fitted model in ROA among the three models of pooled OLS, fixed effect model and random effect model. To achieve the objective of the study, a panel data regression analysis was conducted. According to the analysis, current ratio and ROA has a significant positive relationship while the number of deposits and ROA has a significant negative relationship. As well as, capital adequacy ratio, equity to total assets ratio and liquid assets to total assets ratio have an insignificant relationship with ROA  If a bank can minimize its liquidity risk, it can lead to superior profits and also it will be a competitive advantage to survive in the industry. As the above study has identified the current ratio and deposits have significant influence on the profitability of the banking sector, the banks should consider the following matters in order to minimize the liquidity risk. For managing the liquidity risk, banks must monitor the various liquidity ratios or ", "156": " \n152  triggers like stress testing to gauge the capacity to handle liquidity shocks and monitoring of the liquidity ratios prescribed under Basel III and internal prudential ratios implemented by the top management of the bank.  Running an Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) in the bank  will help to monitor the funding and fulfill the liquidity requirement by pricing of assets and liabilities. Furthermore, ALCO is entrusted with the responsibility of managing the bank\u2019s balance sheet within the performance and risk parameters defined by the Board of Directors. Thus, the bank can implement Board-approved liquidity management policies regularly and review the liquidity, pricing of assets and liability products, cash flow and asset liability maturity mismatches within the bank through ALCO.  Another proper way to minimize the liquidity risk is involving in an intra-day liquidity management system. Fewest of the banks already follow this system. From that, the bank can manage the funding sources and evaluation of structural imbalances in the balance sheet. A large customer deposits base, along with a strong capital base provides strength and support for the maintenance of a strong liquidity position. Further, the banks have to follow fully implemented BASEL III required liquidity standards and maintain liquidity ratios. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) with a considerable cushion over and above the regulatory requirement are needed to mitigate the liquidity risk. Also the Bank can conduct regular stress tests or scenario analysis to measure the impact on liquidity due to adverse movements in the bank\u2019s cash flow.  References  Ajanthan, A. (2013).

It will also be relevant to local government agencies; and will have some relevance to semi-government and private sector organisations.  \nIn many countries the tradition is that records managers do not become involved in \nmanaging financial records; it is generally assumed that financial records management \nis the responsibility of accountants.  However, accounting staff have rarely been introduced to records management principles and practices.  They know what information they require and why, but they seldom receive training on how it should be kept.  Therefore, the care of financial records often falls in the gap between the two professions.  This problem often extends through all financial management functions. \nThe situation has important consequences for the capacity of countries around the \nworld to manage public sector spending and to introduce measures to enhance accountability and transparency.  Records managers have an important role to play in the care of financial records; this module aims to help them understand the functions and tasks involved. \nThe module deliberately contains a large amount of material on financial \nmanagement.  There is considerable emphasis on the analysis of stakeholders (or users), on functions and processes and on information flows.  Financial records are examined in this context.  ", "11": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n2 There are two reasons for including a high level of financial information in this \nmodule.  First, in many countries there is no easy way for records managers to obtain this information, and unless they can speak the language of accountants and auditors, they will not be able to make an effective contribution.  Second, financial systems are so complex that there is no way to teach records managers how to manage the records generated by these systems other than by equipping them to analyse the various components of financial systems and then to apply records management principles.  \nThe module does not seek to cover records management principles in any depth, as \nthey are covered in detail in other modules.  However, it does address records issues that specifically affect financial records. \nThe following key terms used in the module are defined here, so that users are \nfamiliar with them as they work through the lessons.  A more detailed glossary of financial terms is also included as an annex to this module. \n \nFinancial management:  The planning, controlling, \nimplementation and monitoring of fiscal policies and \nactivities, including the accounting and audit of \nrevenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities. \nRecords management : That area of general \nadministrative management concerned with achieving \neconomy and efficiency in the creation, maintenance, use and disposal of the records of an organisation \nthroughout their entire life cycle and in making the \ninformation they contain available in support of the \nbusiness of that organisation.. \nAccountability:  The requirement to perform duties, \nincluding financial and operational responsibilities, in a \nmanner that complies with legislation, policies, objectives and expected standards of conduct. \nFinancial records:  Records resulting from the conduct \nof business and activities relating to financial \nmanagement. \n \nUsers of the module should bear in mind that financial management and records \nmanagement operate in a dynamic and changing environment.  The information provided in this module offers sound principles for the management of financial records, but specific management strategies will change over time and will differ from country to country. \nThe module addresses records care at an advanced level; those studying it should have \na solid grounding in and experience with records management.  Students using this module should have worked through or be familiar with the issues discussed in the core and advanced modules in this study programme before beginning.

This includes time spent doing the reading and considering the study questions. At the end of each lesson there is a summary of the major points.  Sources for \nadditional information are provided in Lesson 7.  In addition to the various terms defined throughout the module and included in the master glossary to the MPSR study programme, this module includes a glossary of specific financial terms, added as an appendix to the end of the module. \nThroughout each lesson, activities have been included to help you think about the \ninformation provided.  Each activity is a \u2018self-assessed\u2019 project; there is no \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 answer.  Rather, the activity is designed to encourage you to explore the ideas presented and relate them to the environment in which you are studying or working.  If you are studying these modules independently and are not part of a records or ", "14": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n5 archives management organisation, you should try to complete the activities with a \nhypothetical situation if possible.  If the activity suggests writing something, you should keep this brief and to the point; this is not a marked or graded exercise and you should only spend as much time on the activity as you feel necessary to understand the information being taught.  You are encouraged to write down your answers for all of the activities and keep the answers together in a booklet or file; you may want to refer back to your answers as you work through this module or through other modules in this study programme.  \nFollowing the summary at the end of each lesson are a number of self-study \nquestions.  Note that these self-study questions are designed to help you review the material in this module.  They are not intended to be graded or marked exercises.  You should complete as many of the questions as you feel will help you to understand the concepts presented.  External assessments, such as assignments or exams, will be included separately when this module becomes part of a graded educational programme. \nADDITIONAL RESOURCES  \nThis module assumes that you have access to a records office, records centre or archival institution and that you have some involvement with the management of financial records.  The various activities may ask you to draw on your own experiences and compare those with the information provided in the lessons.  If you do not have access to such facilities, you may need to develop a fictitious scenario for \nyour activities.  Alternately, you may wish to discuss this module with friends or \ncolleagues who work with records and archives so that you can discuss principles and concepts with them and compare your understanding with theirs. \nCase Studies \nThe following case study will provide valuable additional information. \n15: Pino Akotia, Ghana, \u2018Management of Financial Records: The Ghana Case \nStudy\u2019 ", "15": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n6 LESSON 1 \nTHE IMPORTANCE OF RECORD KEEPING \nFOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  \nFinancial management involves planning, controlling, implementing and monitoring \nfiscal policies and activities, including accounting and auditing revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.  It embraces daily cash management as well as the formulation of short-, medium- and long-term financial objectives, policies and strategies in support of the organisation\u2019s business.  Financial management also includes planning and controlling capital expenditure, managing assets, liaising with the treasury and making decisions related to funding and performance. \nGood financial management is critical to the success of any organisation, whatever its \nsize and whether or not it is in the public, private or voluntary sector.  In the public sector, the rendering of accounts to public scrutiny is key to accountable government. Financial records are produced in every area of financial management.  If these records not are well managed, the financial management function suffers.  Therefore, financial records management and records management are closely intertwined. \nFinancial management makes an important contribution to government, particularly in \nthe areas of \n\u2022 accountability \n\u2022 efficiency \n\u2022 ensuring resources are matched to objectives \n\u2022 economic stability. \nThis lesson examines these four areas of financial management.  It then discusses \nchanging approaches to financial management, and it examines the relationship between financial management and records.  It concludes with a discussion of the senior management issues involved in financial records management and emphasises the importance of securing senior management support for the involvement of records managers in financial records care. \nAccountability \nAccountability is fundamental to good governance.  Accountability is the process that allows people to measure and verify the performance of government.  Financial accountability is a critical component of accountable government.  It involves ", "16": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n7 legislative control of the executive through budgets and accounts.  Weaknesses in \nfinancial accountability are generally linked to weaknesses in public accounting, expenditure control, cash management, auditing and the management of financial records.  An enhanced level of control over financial management is vital for all governments to maintain their commitment to their citizens. \nEnsuring Resources are Matched to Objectives \nFinancial management ensures that money is allocated in accordance with the government\u2019s strategic priorities.  This is achieved by controlling the budget approved by the legislature and is reinforced by the publication of audited accounts of what was actually spent. \nEfficiency \nPublic sector financial management has been the focus of increasing attention in recent years.  Reductions in public expenditure have pressured public authorities to maintain services with less money.  To achieve cuts, financial managers have had to improve their financial analysis as a basis for improving efficiency and value for money. \nTraditionally, financial management in government has focused on controlling \nexpenditure; the main emphasis has been on keeping public spending down in order to minimise borrowing.  However, private sector financial management techniques have increasingly been imported into the public sector.  For example the National Audit Office may carry out \u2018value for money\u2019 audits, which look beyond whether the money was spent according to the government\u2019s financial regulations to whether the public is getting an economic, efficient and effective service.  In other words, financial systems in government are changing from systems designed to keep the government from spending too much to systems that ensure the government makes the best use of resources. \nEconomic Stability \nEvery modern government needs to define an economic policy and then manage its economy according to that policy.  Much of a country\u2019s economy depends upon the private sector, but it can also be influenced by the government\u2019s fiscal policies, interest rates and regulatory environment.  \nGovernment itself is a major component of a nation\u2019s economy.  Public sector \nborrowing and expenditure have an impact on the stability of the overall economy.  Governments can improve their capacity to manage the economy by introducing reforms of the treasury, budget preparation and approval procedures.  Reforms can also be made in tax administration, accounting and audit mechanisms, central bank operations and the preparation of official statistics.  These reforms will help ensure ", "17": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n8 the government manages its finances well and contributes to the overall stability of \nthe nation. \nCHANGING APPROACHES TO FINANCIAL \nMANAGEMENT  \nRecords managers need to stay abreast of changing trends in financial management.  \nChanges to financial management processes will inevitably affect the information systems needed to support them and the records generated by them.  Each country will have different experiences with financial management, as the country\u2019s own financial circumstances and political and cultural factors will create different requirements.  The most successful systems are those that have been tailored to meet specific country needs.  \nVarious approaches to financial management have been designed and tested in recent \nyears.  The recent trend is to move the focus away from measuring inputs toward measuring outputs: that is, to focus less on how much money has been spent on what product and more on whether the work performed has been useful.  Public sector financial management is increasingly seen as a tool to enable management to discharge its responsibilities more efficiently and effectively.  These trends are revolutionising government accounting practices, standards and reporting systems.  \nFor example, the changing perspective in financial management has led to changes in \nthe process of budgeting.  There are now several different methods of budgeting, including the following. \n\u2022 Line item budgeting lists expenditures for the coming year according to objects of \nexpenditure, or \u2018line\u2019 items.  These budgets specify how much money a particular \nagency is permitted to spend on personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, and so on. \n\u2022 Performance budgeting divides proposed expenditures into activities and relates \nthe activity to cost.  This method allows the budget to be built on the basis of \nanticipated workload rather than incrementally, as in traditional line-item budgeting.  \n\u2022 Programme budgeting focuses on budgetary choices among competing policies \nand treats the different budget objectives as variable. \n\u2022 Zero-based budgeting arrives at a budget by literally starting from scratch.  At the \nnational level, this would require answering such questions as \u2018what if we did not \nhave an army?\u2019 or \u2018what if national insurance did not exist?\u2019  This has not proved useful as an annual budget tool. \nAs governments develop more business-type functions and operate services on a \ncommercial basis, the public sector is adopting features of private sector accounting.  For example there is a move from cash accounting to accruals accounting. ", "18": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n9 \u2022 Cash accounting includes only the transactions that actually take place within the \nperiod covered by the account. \n\u2022 Accruals accounting reflects all the financial transactions proper to the period of \nthe account, regardless of whether the account has actually been paid during that \ntime. \nCash accounting is traditional in central government.  Under this system, receipts and \npayments are recognised only when cash is received or paid.  The emphasis is on the objects and purposes for which funds have been received and paid out during a particular period.  Cash accounting is also used when the system lacks enough sophistication to implement accruals accounting and the benefits of changing methods do not justify the costs involved. \nAccruals accounting recognises transactions when they occur, irrespective of when \ncash is paid or received.  Transactions are recorded in the accounting record and reported in the financial statements of the period in which the service was received (expenditure) or rendered (revenue). \nFinancial statements prepared on an accrual basis indicate past transactions involving \npayment and receipt of cash, as well as future obligations to pay and payments to be received in the future.  This method facilitates economic decision making, by making it easier to account for the use of resources, focus on performance and measure outputs. \nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND RECORDS  \nFinancial management systems provide decision makers and public sector managers with the means to \n\u2022 control spending \n\u2022 prioritise expenditures in order to allocate resources efficiently and equitably \n\u2022 make better use of budgeted resources to achieve outcomes and produce outputs at \nthe lowest possible cost. \nAll financial management systems create records, and all financial systems depend \nupon records.  \n \nActivity 1 \nBefore reading further, write a brief description of how you think records contribute \nto financial management.  Write down as many ideas as you can think of. \n ", "19": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n10 The ways in which these  records  contribute to financial management are described \nbelow. \nAccountability and Control \nRecords management reinforces financial management controls and supports accountability.  The ability to establish who did what, when, why and how is a powerful means of deterring individuals from engaging in fraud or corruption, thus enforcing accountability.  Well-managed records provide an unbiased account of responsibility and liability.  Authentic, reliable records provide an unambiguous link between the authorisation to carry out a transaction, the particular individual concerned and the date.  Thus records can identify abuse, misuse and non-compliance with financial instructions.  \nFinancial management also depends upon a system of internal controls that make it \npossible to carry out business in an orderly and efficient manner, ensure adherence to management policies and safeguard assets.  The management of financial records is a critical component of this control system.  Where financial records are not controlled, their completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Records needed for reference, decision making and risk assessment can become difficult to access. \nThe senior official responsible for accounting, such as the Accountant General, \nnormally issues detailed regulations for the control of financial management systems.  In other countries such as Zimbabwe, these regulations are issued by the Public Service Commission.  Complete and accurate records must be available to prove that these controls are functioning properly and consistently.  \nIn turn, these controls help to ensure that the records themselves retain their context, \nstructure and content.  In countries operating the Exchequer system of financial management, there is no Accountant General. Instead, each ministry maintains their own bank accounts and is responsible for their own accounting systems.  The Exchequer system allows for a greater range of diversity of practice than the more centralised approach represented by the Accountant General system.  In the Exchequer system, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury is usually responsible for issuing general regulations where needed.  \nThe aim of a records management programme should be to ensure that those records \nthat provide evidence of financial management activity are systematically controlled throughout the organisation.  \nAccounting and Auditing \nRecords management also supports the accounting function and enables the audit function.  Financial record keeping provides the basis or foundation for accounting and introduces controls that protect essential audit trails.  At the most practical level, if records are disorganised, it will take auditors an excessive amount of time to locate needed documents, if they can find them at all. Individuals guilty of embezzlement ", "20": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n11 may deliberately allow financial records to become disorganised or to be stored in \nunsuitable conditions because this makes it harder for auditors to identify fraud.  Conversely, in some cases government officers have been inappropriately accused of embezzling funds simply because the documents authorising the expenditure could not be located.  Well-organised and well-managed records are essential to combat economic crime and protect the innocent. \nA financial records management programme should enable the physical and logical \ncontrol of records and prevent unauthorised access, tampering, loss or destruction, whether intentional or accidental.  Records management should contribute a layer of security and reassurance that operations are functioning at the level required. \nTaken together, records management, accounting and auditing provide the layers of \ncontrol that are essential to ensuring transparency, probity and integrity in financial management systems.  Although in reality records management is integrally connected to accounting and auditing, their interface is illustrated below in a simple fashion. \nInternal Control/Internal Audit\nProcedures Level\nTransaction LevelCom pliance Level\nFinance/\nAccountingFinancial\nAudit\nOperations = Transactions = RecordsRecords\nManagement\nAudit\nRecords\nManagementExternal Audit\nTHE SYSTEM\n \nFigure 1: The Financial Accountability Cycle", "21": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n12 MANAGEMENT ISSUES  \nIn many respects, financial records are similar to other kinds of administrative \nrecords, and thus many of the professional principles and practices described in other modules in this study programme are applicable.  However, financial records also have unique features that require attention.  \nFinancial record-keeping systems in government are so large and pervasive that \nchanges to the system will need support at a senior level.  Moreover, because financial management systems are subject to accounting and auditing standards and are under the close control and scrutiny of government financial officers, it is essential that records managers gain the support of senior managers and other stakeholders in order to provide an effective financial records management service. \nIt is the record managers\u2019 job to understand how records management can contribute \nto the organisation\u2019s financial management objectives and to articulate the case for efficient records management in terms that senior management can understand.  Therefore, records managers must understand the unique qualities of financial records and the effect of good or poor financial records management on the government or organisation. \n \nActivity 2 \nBefore reading further, write a brief description of as many special features of \nfinancial records that you can think of that will affect their management.  How you \ncould present these issues to senior managers in order to gain their support for \nimproved financial records management? \n \nConsider the following management issues related to financial records care. \nThe Volume, Scope and Complexity of Financial \nRecords \nFinancial records are voluminous.  The records of financial transactions are one of the \nlargest categories of records found in government.  The benefit of managing these records translates into large savings in office space.  Most of these records need to be kept for relatively short periods of time (often only 6 or 7 years, depending upon the relevant legislation), but during that time they are vital for controlling fraud and corruption.  Records related to financial policy are smaller in volume compared to records of transactions, but policy records are very important for the process of developing and then executing policies.  These records can be of considerable historical significance and need to be identified by as having archival value. ", "22": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n13 Further, financial records are found everywhere.  Every aspect of government \ninvolves expenditure and thus requires financial management, which in turn generates records.  These records need managing across the entire spectrum of government. \nMoreover, financial management systems are complex.  The scale of financial \nmanagement and its importance to government has led to the development of a complex and inter-related set of functions and systems including budgeting, accounting, forecasting, purchasing and payroll.  The range of controls and regulators (for instance internal audit, external audit) are also complex.  Records managers must understand the basic principles involved with financial management in order to be credible when working with financial managers.  Records managers must also understand financial management in order to analyse and appraise the records. \nFinancial Records and Accountability \nRecords are essential for financial accountability.  Records provide a reliable, legally verifiable source of evidence of decisions and actions about the management of government finance and are the basis for determining responsibility.  They are a powerful tool in constraining individuals from engaging in corruption.  But if financial records management systems are weak, public servants cannot be held accountable for their decisions and actions.  Fraud and corruption will flourish.  Records management is a cost-effective restraint.  If corrupt officials know that there is an audit trail, they are less likely to take the risk.  Conversely, a clear audit trail can protect the innocent from false accusations.  Where the ultimate sanction of prosecution is appropriate, lawyers will rely heavily upon records to provide the evidence. \nHowever, records management controls are often missing in government financial \ncontrol systems.  The organisation\u2019s financial instructions and the accounting manual will specify rules for the security and use of financial records.  However, these documents tend not to prescribe rules for the management of records.  At the same time, financial records are usually outside the jurisdiction of the organisation\u2019s records manager.  As a result, this vital resource is not managed or controlled adequately.  Failure to manage records can lead to the build up of unwanted records, overcrowding and disorganisation.  This will make it very difficult to retrieve and use financial records efficiently and to carry out the audit process. \nAuditors should comment where there is non-compliance with the legislative \nrequirements for financial record keeping .  Although rules, regulations and procedures \nfor efficient management of financial records may exist on paper, they are of no value if they are not enforced.  Auditors can make a powerful contribution to better records management by commenting on cases where record keeping is inadequate and insisting that management implements sanctions against persistent offenders. \nRegulatory Requirements and Financial Records \nFinancial records should be subject to tight regulation and control.  Financial records are usually subject to legislation that forbids their destruction for a set period of years ", "23": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n14 after the accounts have been audited.  Failure to observe these requirements could \nlead to prosecution.  The legal framework affecting financial records comprises the constitution, which may provide for the supervision and audit of public accounts, and laws relating to finance, audit and government records.  Finance and audit laws generally require ministries, departments and agencies to ensure that financial and accounting records are adequately kept and managed.  They also empower the audit body to obtain access to all financial records.  \nOther legislation enacted in support of government functions may also give rise to \nfinancial records or specify conditions for their maintenance, use or disposal.  For example, pensions legislation imposes an obligation on departments to maintain records of contributions.  Revenue laws may indicate a time limit on the recovery of tax or duties, thereby establishing a minimum period for the retention of revenue files.  Subsidiary requirements such as accounting instructions and financial regulations are frequently promulgated under powers conferred by a main law, such as a finance act.  These subsidiary requirements lay down more detailed conditions and requirements for accounting and financial records, including their creation, filing, storage, production and disposal. \nFinancial Records and Computers \nFinancial records are increasingly created using computers.  Financial functions are usually among the first to be automated.  Most countries have automated payroll systems and many have automated budget and accounting systems.  In some countries the entire financial management function has been incorporated into a single automated integrated financial management system.  Financial records are often the first electronic records that records managers are likely to encounter. \nWith the increasing use of electronic technologies, record keeping is becoming \ntechnically more complex.  Although the fundamental principles for keeping records in an electronic environment are more or less the same as in a paper environment, the skills required to manage them may be different.  Records professionals and information technology (IT) specialists need to co-operate closely.  This may require the creation of a specialised electronic records unit within the National Archives.  The unit will require specialised equipment and an enhanced set of professional capacities. \nComputerisation has implications for audit evidence.  The principles relating to audit \nevidence do not change because an audit is being carried out in a computer environment.  Computer records in the form of data on magnetic disks or optical disks still provide the auditor with audit assurance. \nThere are few precedents that address the admissibility of computer records in a court \nof law.  Where computer evidence has been submitted in legal cases the courts have taken into account expert evidence on the effectiveness of the IT control environment before assessing the reliability of the computer data.  Computerised transactions or images of documents may be inadmissible as legal evidence unless controls can be shown to be so strong as to remove reasonable doubt about the authenticity and integrity of data held by the system.  Some of these controls are recorded on paper.  It ", "24": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n15 is therefore important that both the electronic records and the paper records that \ndocument the control environment are managed properly. \nCreating an enabling environment will enhance the success of records management \nprogrammes.  Institutions need to promote an environment which will encourage the better maintenance and use of records systems.  Senior management should support an agenda for the future that includes \n\u2022 developing a culture for creating, maintaining and using records \n\u2022 strengthening the role of records management and records managers within an \ninstitution \n\u2022 identifying and strengthening records legislation \n\u2022 defining and implementing records related standards \n\u2022 developing tools to assess the vulnerability of records systems to corruption and \nfraud \n\u2022 imposing disciplinary action for poor record keeping and providing incentives for \nbetter records management.  \nThe Need for Financial Records Management \nFinancial records tend to be excluded from the records management process.  Despite \nthe fact that financial records are covered under the broad legislation governing the management of government records and archives, financial records tend to be stored separately from other records and even excluded from the jurisdiction of the records manager.  In this situation, the volume of records may grow uncontrolled until is exceeds the space available to store it.  Then the systems to control and retrieve the records will break down.  \nThe breakdown of financial systems are often related to the breakdown in records \nmanagement.  People rarely make the link between problems in financial management and inadequacies in the way records are managed, yet records are the source of all the information used in financial management systems.  If records become so disorganised that it is difficult or impossible to audit properly, the long-term effect will be that fraud or errors will not be detected or corrected. \nWhen a system of financial management breaks down, the consequences are serious.  \nTypical symptoms include the following. \n\u2022 Monitoring systems are inadequate and information is difficult to access. \n\u2022 Votes ledgers are not kept properly, and an important tool for expenditure control \nis lost. \n\u2022 Accounts are not produced on time, rendering them of limited value for \nexpenditure control and monitoring. \n\u2022 The audit process is ineffective.

Government systems are large and complex, and the fact that the public sector is accountable to the people adds a layer of complexity that is reflected in the various roles, responsibilities and information needs of public servants. \nA stakeholder can be defined as follows: \nA stakeholder  is any person, group or organisation that \nhas a claim on the organisation\u2019s attention, resources or \noutput, or is affected by that output. \nKey stakeholders in public sector financial management include some or all of the \nfollowing: the public, the head of state, the legislature, the government itself and in particular the cabinet.

The legislature sanctions the financial plan or budget and authorises the executive to \n\u2022 make expenditures (within pre-determined limits) \n\u2022 invest \n\u2022 raise revenue (such as taxation, borrowing) \n\u2022 administer programmes in accordance with any laws that may affect them.  \nThe legislature is responsible for the management of the whole of government \nfinancial reporting.  The documentation required and produced by this process includes \n\u2022 annual budget \n\u2022 the fiscal policy statement \n\u2022 budget estimates and projections \n\u2022 Public Accounts Committee reports. \nThe legislature has the right and responsibility to hold the government and its units \naccountable for the management of financial affairs and for the use of financial resources.  In practice, independently audited government financial statements are an important means by which governments and units demonstrate their accountability.  In many countries, the Public Accounts Committee scrutinises these statements. \nExecutive \nThe executive has responsibility for the management of financial resources.  This includes planning, directing and controlling operations and reporting on financial administration. \nThe Public \nThe public has an interest in ensuring that public money is accounted for and spent wisely.  Citizens rarely have direct access to public sector financial records except in the form of published government accounts.  In practice these are seldom read by the general public, but citizens are, or should be kept informed about them by means of the press and national political debate. ", "31": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n22 International and Bilateral Aid Agencies \nAlthough these agencies are not part of the formal constitutional arrangements for \npublic sector financial management, in many developing countries they are de facto \nstakeholders.  They provide funding in the form of grants or loans for a large proportion of public sector projects in many countries in the world. \nExamples of international bodies include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the \nWorld Bank, the United National Development Programme (UNDP), and regional development banks such as the African Development Bank or the Asian Development Bank.  The British Government\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), and the Danish international aid agency (DANIDA) are all examples of bilateral donors.  Each has its own rules for financial reporting on the projects it funds, and the recipient country will be expected to follow these rules.  The records this generates are often kept separately from the government\u2019s other financial records, and their treatment may not be consistent with the government\u2019s financial instructions.  This can fragment the financial management system, with information in several locations. \nOPERATIONAL -LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS  \nWhile all public sector organisations create and maintain financial records, certain core institutions have key roles to play in the operation of financial systems and management of the records they generate.  The core agencies are described below. \nCentral Bank \nThe central bank is responsible for maintaining the country\u2019s monetary policy, issuing bank notes, regulating and supporting the country\u2019s principal systems for clearing and settling payments and acting as fiscal agent for federal government debt.  \nIn countries where the civil service accounting system has deteriorated, policy makers \nwill rely on records of cash balances in the central bank.  They provide a crude but accurate picture of how much has been spent and how much money the government has received from taxation and other sources.  The records of the central bank are highly sensitive and are often managed entirely separately from other public sector financial records. \n ", "32": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n23 Finance/Economic Planning Agencies \nThe ministry or department in charge of finance and economic planning plays a major \nrole in translating the political objectives of the government into financial policies and workable instructions to departments and budgetary units. \nThe finance ministry is responsible for overall management and control of public \nexpenditure, government debt, fiscal policy and long-term financial planning.  It is also responsible for deciding what resources are necessary and how to distribute the resources.  This brings the ministry close to the political sphere.  In countries that operate planned economy models of economic development, the ministry in charge of planning, such as a National Development Planning Commission, may also contribute to planning the preparation of the budget and its execution. \nThe finance ministry\u2019s treasury function comprises two activities: \n\u2022 setting policy \n\u2022 physically handling funds. \nFor historical reasons, in many former British colonies the institution of the Treasury \nwas abolished and replaced with a Department (later Ministry) of Finance responsible for policy and an Accountant General\u2019s Department responsible for the physical handling of funds. \nIn other countries that are part of the British administrative tradition, the Exchequer \nsystem, as it is known, often continues to operate.  Responsibility for managing money is decentralised to ministries and departments, but they are ultimately are answerable to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  The Treasury brings together and co-ordinates the data which is produced by each individual produced by each individual ministry or department.  Each ministry must work within the confines of the appropriate government regulations and must produce accounts which, when submitted to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, provide data for the preparation of the final government published accounts. \nAccountant General \nSome countries operate a centralised system of accounting controlled by an Accountant General.  The Accountant General, as the government\u2019s principal accounting officer and adviser on accounting policy, is responsible for regulating the receipt and disbursement of funds.  He or she is responsible for overseeing accounting policies and procedures and for introducing changes as appropriate.  The Accountant General will normally be responsible for controlling any centralised accounting system used by the civil service.  If the accounting system is computerised, the operation will often be in the hands of an IT unit run from within the Accountant General\u2019s department.  Typically, there will be a separate payroll unit to handle the payment of civil servants.  This payroll function is often computerised. ", "33": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n24 Supreme Audit Institution \nIn many countries the supreme audit institution is the Auditor General\u2019s department or \na National Audit Office.  The supreme audit institution is responsible for examining, evaluating and reporting independently on the ministries and departments on the collection, expenditure and management of public funds and resources. \nThe supreme audit institution is also responsible for \u2018value for money\u2019 audits.  Value \nfor money audits examine the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which an organisation has used its resources in discharging its functions.  \n\u2022 Economy involves minimising cost (spending less). \n\u2022 Efficiency involves maximising output for a given input or minimising input for a \ngiven output (spending well).  \n\u2022 Effectiveness involves ensuring the results achieve the objectives, goals or \nintended effects (spending wisely). \nWhile auditing has traditionally been about financial management and performance, \nthere is a growing tendency to expand the role to include monitoring the performance of particular programmes or functions.  External auditors are becoming involved in performance auditing for a range of government activities, involving reporting on how activities or programmes are carried out and what systems and controls are in place for monitoring and reporting.  Auditors are thus increasingly interested in issues such as corporate governance of public sector bodies, ethical management, risk management and accountability. \nInternal Revenue and Customs and Excise \nDepartments \nThese departments are responsible for the collection of government revenues.  \nInternal Revenue usually comprises taxes on the income of individuals (income tax), on the profits of companies (corporation tax), on the gain in the value of capital assets (capital gains tax), on inherited wealth (inheritance tax) and on transfers of titles to assets (stamp duty).  The Customs and Excise Department collects taxes on goods and services (value added tax), import and export duties (customs), and duties on petrol, spirits, tobacco, betting and gaming. \nHeads of Ministries/Departments \nThe heads of ministries and departments are responsible for the management of their internal accounting systems.  In many countries, the permanent head of the department is the accounting officer, but he or she will usually be able to draw upon the services of an officer responsible for administration and finance who will be responsible for the daily operation of the financial management systems within the department.  In many Commonwealth countries, there is an accounting cadre/service under the control of a head (usually the Accountant General); this group provides ", "34": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n25 accounting staff to ministries and departments.  This group may also include internal \naudit staff posted to government departments. \nIn countries operating the Exchequer system there is no Accountant General (see \nabove).  Instead, ministries or departments have accounting staff appointed through the normal civil service appointments system \u2013 usually the Civil Service Commission.  Individual ministries or departments operate and manage their own bank accounts, keep their own accounting own accounting records and are answerable in the final analysis to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.  Thus each ministry has greater flexibility and degree of control over accounting and financial operations relating to their functions. \nInternal Audit Units \nInternal audit is an appraisal or monitoring activity set up by the management of an organisation to review and evaluate accounting and internal control systems.  As such, it can be considered to be part of an organisation\u2019s overall control system.  In the central government sector, accounting officers are responsible for establishing appropriate internal audit arrangements within their departments.  Often this takes the form of an internal audit unit.  \nCentral Computing Bureau/IT Department  \nComputerised financial systems need to be maintained by IT specialists.  Sometimes these specialists are organised into units dedicated to supporting specific strategic applications, such as payroll.  These units are often physically located at the ministry in charge of finance.  In other cases, they are operated by a central computing bureau on behalf of that ministry.  In either case, IT specialists have a responsibility for providing advice on the choice of IT standards, systems and applications.  \nNational Archives/National Records Service \nThe National Archives has a statutory responsibility for the preservation of financial records of permanent value.  In addition it should have a role in ensuring that all government financial records are managed from the point of creation.  It has an obligation to respect the interests of other stakeholders, especially the Auditor General and Accountant General, in controlling the security, use and treatment of financial records.

Controls are defined at several levels as described below. \n\u2022 Financial legislation and financial instructions help to define the functional areas \nthat govern financial management.  The financial instructions specify the detailed \ncontrols needed to ensure that transactions are properly authorised and documented and that they do not exceed the amount of money assigned for that purpose. \n\u2022 Within most legislative frameworks, revenue received by governments is paid into \na fund, and any expenditure from the fund must be formally appropriated by the \nlegislature.

The records manager must thoroughly understand the particular laws, regulations and controls that apply when analysing a financial management system in real life.  They are also important to take into account when making appraisal decisions.  All of these will be written records that must be managed somewhere within the governmental system.  In some cases (eg laws), they will be published.  At this stage, it is sufficient that the student understands that they are important for ensuring that financial operations are in line with good practice and government policy. \nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT : MAIN \nFUNCTIONS AND PROCESSES  \nFigure 4 below illustrates the complex inter-relationships involved in financial management.  It shows the links between the overall legislative and regulatory framework and the processes that flow from it.  These processes relate to three aspects of financial management: \n1. budget preparation \n2. budget implementation and case management \n3. accounts administration and auditing. \nAt the broader level, these processes are carried out by the central agencies \nresponsible for budget and cash management.

In broad terms, a financial management system can be broken down into ten primary functions.  Together, these functions make up the financial management cycle, as described below. \n1. Macro-fiscal planning  establishes the policy objectives and needs for financial \nresources and a forward-looking strategy for revenue and expenditure.  For example, the fiscal policy and medium-term expenditure plan should contain statements of government objectives, policies and priorities; strategies for achieving objectives; a resource framework for the plan period and a programme of sectoral development to be implemented during this period.  It is the first step toward preparing the budget and involves contributions from line ministries as well as from the ministry of finance and other central agencies. \n2. Budget preparation  involves allocating resources to achieve the objectives of \ngovernment.  It is a management tool for national economic and fiscal planning and for controlling the use of funds to ensure that the stated objectives can be met.  The budget preparation process is most successful when linked to a longer term macro-fiscal plan. \n3. Budget implementation  follows approval of the budget by the legislature, when \nfunding allocated to specific areas and items of expenditure can take place. \n4. Budget monitoring and evaluation  provides a method of feedback to the fiscal \nplanning and policy area.  Linking budgeting to accounting enables financial managers to receive the feedback needed to adjust planned activities to expected resources. \n5. Cash management  is an integral part of financial management.  It provides an up-to-\ndate picture of the amount of cash in government accounts and the amounts of cash \nneeded.  Cash management compares data from cash flow forecasts and fiscal reports \nto data on cash balances, government bonds, treasury bills and cash deposit maturities.  In many countries, cash management tends to occur at a high level involving the central bank (or similar body). \n6. Debt management  involves managing all transactions relating to external loans.  It \nalso serves as the mechanism for calculating the future cost of servicing the debt. \n7. Foreign aid management  matches aid agencies to projects and oversees the process of \nproject negotiations. ", "44": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n35 8. Revenue administration  executes tax policies through the levy and collection of \nrevenues (including taxes, duties, etc) as stipulated by these policies.  It also involves the valuation and collection of non-tax revenues, such as stamp duties or charges for government services. \n9. Accounts administration  is the means by which government assembles and analyses \naccounting information to help it to control business, safeguard assets, prepare financial statements and comply with legislation. \n10. Auditing  is the means of reviewing the accuracy and reliability of financial \ninformation produced by financial management functions.  \nIt is important to understand these functions as a basis for analysing government \nfinancial systems.  The objectives of each function are met through a series of processes as shown in the tables which follow. \n \nActivity 4 \nBefore studying the chart below, carefully consider each of the ten functions listed \nabove.  Find out which of these financial functions are carried out by your \norganisation and which are carried out by others.  Identify who in your organisation is \nresponsible for each of those functions that are carried out by your organisation.  \nWrite down the name of the department or agency.  Then, choose two of the \nfunctions, other than the function of preparing an annual budget, which is given as an \nexample below.  For each of those two functions, write down all the processes you \ncan think of that must be performed to fulfil that function.  \nFor example, consider the processes that must be done to fulfil the function of \npreparing a budget.  They will likely include \n\u2022 determining initial budget allocations \n\u2022 informing various agencies in the government of budget ceilings for the next year \nand seeking their input \n\u2022 analysing the information received from those agencies \n\u2022 preparing a draft budget as a result of that information received \n\u2022 finalising the budget for presentation to the legislature. \nYour list for the two functions you have examined should look the same: a short \nstatement of each of the steps (processes) involved in completing that activity.

Lesson 4 is concerned with analysing the records generated from these functions and processes.  This lesson demonstrates how business systems analysis can be used to build up a picture of information flows in relation to financial functions and processes.  \nAnalysing Business Systems explores the techniques \nof business systems analysis in greater depth.  \nINFORMATION FLOWS  \nEach of the functions and processes examined in Lesson 3 requires records as inputs \nand generates records as outputs.  \nInput:  Any resource required for the functioning of a \nprocess, in the course of which it will be transformed \ninto one or more outputs. \nOutput:  The product of the transformation of inputs by \na process. \nFor example, a payment voucher to authorise payment of goods supplied to a ministry \nis an input to the accounting system.  The output is the cheque issued to the supplier \nOne way to examine these inputs and outputs is to study the information flows \nassociated with the particular process being examined.  Stakeholders must be \nconsulted, and individual processes can be analysed in greater depth by studying the \ninformation flows associated with the process.  This analysis builds up a picture of the existing documentation controls and thus provides the basis for taking records management decisions.  \nThe data gathering exercise should lead to a flow diagram with a narrative text, \ndescribing in detail the steps involved in the process.  As each function will be made up of one or more processes, it is necessary to analyse each of them before the ", "54": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n45 complete picture will emerge.  The records manager needs to understand the \nrelationship between all these factors when making decisions about records. \nThis analytic approach is best illustrated with the following example. In a small Commonwealth country, a records manager was asked to improve the \nhandling of records relating to payments.  He began by studying the accounting manual, which was an invaluable source of information about the main accounting records, their formats and the procedures for processing payments.  \nThe Auditor General\u2019s office should have documented the payments process as part of \nthe routine audit of the financial system and recorded any departures from the accounting manual.  However, the records manager discovered that this had not been done.  It was therefore necessary to trace the payment process through the system and to interview the relevant officers at each stage.  \nUltimately, the records manager produced the flow diagram shown below and a chart \nof the procedures, the records generated and the documentation controls in place.  \nBy the time the records manager had completed the analysis, he had most of the \ninformation he needed to identify the series required to support the payments functions.  In most cases the records derived from the records column in his chart formed clear series.  His last step was to refine his analysis to define the series and to create retention schedules to cover all of the series created including the computer data files and the systems documentation.  \n ", "55": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n46  \nBudgets and Allocations  \nMINISTRY\nOriginal and Duplicate\nPayment Vouchers\nVote Charge BookMINISTRY OF\nFINANCE\nInternal Audit UnitOFFICE OF THE\nACCOUNTANT GENERAL\n\u2013 TREASURY UNIT\nReceiving Unit\nVerification Unit\nCheque Preparation\nCashier\nOriginal Payment Voucher\nDuplicate Payment Voucher\nand supporting documents\nOutstoreOFFICE OF THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL\n\u2013 ACCOUNTING UNIT\nOutput  Batch Input Batch\nControl Control\nFile\nOriginal Payment Original Payment\nVoucher Voucher\nLedger printout\nDATA PROCESSING AND\nINFORMATION UNIT\nLedger Printouts\nOFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERALBudgets and Allocations\n \n \n     \nFigure 6: Illustration of Documentation Flow in Relation to the Payment Function", "56": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n47 Analysis of Documentation Flow in Relation to the Payments Function  \nDepartments of State \nProcedures Records Documentation Controls \n1.1 Raise requisition departmental requisition book forms serially numbered \ncopy retained in unit \n1.2 Obtain goods, services \u2022 local purchase order (LPO)  \n\u2022 Petty contract  \n\u2022 Claim/petty cash voucher  forms serially numbered \ncopy retained in unit \n1.3 Submit for payment payment voucher in triplicate ministry reference number; \nvoucher dated LPO Number. \naccount code. \ncopy retained in unit. \n1.4 Enter in main ledger vote charge book  retained in unit for \nreconciliation with monthly print out from Accountant General. \n1.5 Send to Internal Audit \u2022 voucher way book \n\u2022 payment vouchers and \nsupporting documents e.g. \nrequisition, invoices voucher way book signed by \nInternal Audit for receipt of original and duplicate payments \nvouchers, LPOs and all \nsupporting documents. \nInternal Audit Unit \nProcedures  Records Documentation Controls \n2.1 Receive vouchers voucher way book of \nministry/department all vouchers from ministry \nsigned by internal audit. \n2.2 Register vouchers by \ndepartment departmental register date of receipt and voucher \nreference. \n2.3 Approve/check vouchers payment voucher  voucher signed by principal \naccountant; date stamp \n2.4 Ensure funds available vote control book vote control book; retained in \ninternal audit unit. \n2.5 Validate Local Purchase \nOrder LPO register LPO register; retained in \ninternal audit unit. \n2.6 Ascertain daily cash flow \nfor Ministry of Finance daily register of vouchers Maintained in date order with \nvoucher reference; retained in \ninternal audit unit. \n2.7 Transfer vouchers to \nTreasury unit voucher list/way book Entries serially numbered. \noriginal and duplicate payments vouchers, LPOs and all supporting documents (requisitions, invoices) sent to \nTreasury receiving unit.

For example, the revenue administration function will normally have at least two distinct sets of systems: tax administration systems and customs administration systems.  In many countries these systems are computerised, but they could also be manual systems, or a mixture of the two.  The macroeconomic framework document, the fiscal plan and budget records will be used to determine what taxes and customs are collected.  The systems will be used to administer the process of tax and customs gathering and the most important records generated by these systems will be records of the tax and customs revenue.  \nEach  of the functions listed in the table below will generate large volumes of \ntransaction records.  The table provides a high level \u2018at a glance\u2019 listing of all government financial management functions.  It is important to thoroughly understand the table because it provides the means for the records manager to have a meaningful dialogue with financial managers about the systems they use and the records generate \nby them.  \nFor each function, the associated processes should be analysed when setting up a \nrecords management programme.  The table provides a framework to assist records managers in planning this process, prioritising the detailed analytic work, identifying the main systems that generate records and relating them to broader functional areas, identifying key stakeholders to be consulted and identifying important categories of records.  \nComplete the following activity and then compare your findings with the information \npresented in the figure.

Usually the first financial management function to be computerised is the payroll, because payroll management is a routine operation and the benefits of automation are substantial.  Accounting and debt management systems are also prime targets for computerisation.  Such systems produce both paper and electronic records, but the electronic records do not need to be kept for long periods.  Therefore, in practice the records manager should focus on managing the paper inputs and outputs.  \nSome governments have installed integrated financial management systems, which \nare computer-based, inter-related sets of sub-systems that plan, process and report upon financial resources.  Integrated financial management systems are discussed separately in Lesson 6.  \nAlthough financial records may differ from other records in certain respects, they \nshould be managed as part of the framework of the organisation\u2019s overall records management policy.  There is no universally applicable system for the management of financial records.  Every organisation must take account of its own particular context, needs and resources.  However, an effective mixed paper/electronic system would be expected to reflect the basic elements discussed in this lesson. \nThe lesson considers the implications of computerisation for the management of \nfinancial records.  It then explores the steps involved in managing financial records in a mixed paper/electronic environment. \nIMPLICATIONS OF COMPUTERISATION FOR \nFINANCIAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT  \nIt can be very difficult to protect electronically created personnel information and make it available.  Managing Electronic Records explores these issues in detail.  In ", "73": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n64 summary, the following key factors affect the management of electronic records over \ntime. \n\u2022 The electronic storage media is fragile and changes with time. \n\u2022 In order to understand the record when it is retrieved in future, it is essential to \ncapture sufficient accurate contextual and structural information about the record. \n\u2022 Changes in technology mean that records that were generated on computers ten \nyears ago may not be accessible today.  Electronic records must be moved to new \ncomputer systems (\u2018migrated\u2019) periodically so that they remain accessible. \n\u2022 Often the responsibility for the management of the integrity of electronic records \nhas not been assigned, making it difficult to ensure they are cared for adequately. \nTypically, problems with automation arise in three areas.  First is the maintenance of \nelectronic records.  Records are dependent upon the computer environment in which they were created and if those computers cease to be available , the records may \nbecome inaccessible.  Second is the control of access to records.  Many people can gain access to information in computers, so it is important to ensure only authorised personnel work with electronic records, otherwise information may be altered inappropriately or without approval.  Third is the control of versions of records.  Because computer records can be altered easily, and the changes may not be readily apparent, it is important to ensure official records are protected from change over time. \nWhere there has been no attempt to manage electronic records, the organisation is \nexposed to a number of risks, including \n\u2022 uncontrolled accumulation of records, documents and data \n\u2022 inadvertent destruction of records, documents and data \n\u2022 unauthorised tampering with records and documents \n\u2022 absence of systems documentation and associated structural and contextual \ninformation (known as \u2018metadata\u2019). \nMetadata:  The information about a record that explains \nthe technical and administrative processes used to \ncreate, manipulate, use and store that record. \nThe consequences of inadequate care of electronic records may include the following: \n\u2022 increased risk of wholesale, unsystematic and possibly illegal destruction of \nrecords \n\u2022 loss of valuable business records and archives \n\u2022 increased risk of security breaches \n\u2022 unauthorised alteration or deletion of records (loss of evidence) \n\u2022 public embarrassment ", "74": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n65 \u2022 unnecessary delays or breakdowns in the business process \n\u2022 lack of public accountability \n\u2022 system paralysis or, at the very least, difficulties in accessing information. \nEssentially the records manager needs to answer a number of basic questions. \n1. Are the financial systems producing electronic records? \n2. Is there a need to keep the records electronically? \n3. Is there a risk that they cannot be accessed when needed because the media, software \nor hardware may become obsolete? \n4. Can printouts from the system provide all the information needed? \nIn many cases, the automated systems are carrying out high volume, routine \ntransactions, such as payroll.  It is not usually necessary to keep these records for long periods because they usually cease to be of use to the original creators after they have been audited and kept for their statutory retention period.  They seldom have permanent cultural or historical value. \nIn practice, for the present the records manager can usually concentrate on managing \nthe paper records that form the inputs and outputs to the computerised system, as well as related paper records such as contracts and policy documents.  Nonetheless, the electronic records should be scheduled for retention or disposal along with the paper records.  In future, it is very likely that electronic records will become the main format in which financial records will be preserved, and it will be essential for records managers to develop the capacity to do so. \nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF \nELECTRONIC RECORDS MANAGERS  \nAlthough the fundamental principles for keeping records in an electronic environment are more or less the same as in a paper environment, the skills required to manage them may be different.  \nAs the Canadian archival writer and educator Terry Cook has noted: \n\u2026for the first time, [records managers and archivists] are not \nproducing, managing, and saving physical things or artefacts, but rather trying to understand and preserve logical and virtual patterns ", "75": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n66 that give electronic information its structure, content, and context, and \nthus its meaning as a \u2018record\u2019 or as evidence of acts and transactions.  1 \nManaging records within an electronic system or in a mixed paper/electronic \nenvironment requires new partnerships between information professionals.  In general, the decision to use computers to manage financial records will be taken by senior managers, with technical advice from information technologists.  The development and introduction of computerised financial systems should involve collaboration between all key individuals, including financial managers, information technology (IT) staff and records managers.  Financial managers, as the users, need to determine their own requirements.  IT systems programmers will be primarily concerned with developing and introducing current systems and preparing for the next generation of systems.  It is the role of the records professionals to bring a longer term perspective to the project and to ensure that records management principles are safeguarded. \nIn many countries, records managers previously have not been involved in the \nmanagement of financial records.  When extending records management into what may be, in effect, a new area, there is potential for a conflict of interests in the management and control of the records.  The roles and responsibilities of the records manager, the accounting staff and the auditors are complementary, but the scope of their duties must be clearly defined, documented and communicated.  \nThe scope of the records management authority\u2019s powers and responsibilities should \nbe defined and set out in a records procedures manual.  This should be distributed to all staff concerned and the financial and accounting staff should be encouraged to see the records procedures manual as a complement to the financial instructions and accounting manual.  \nThe written procedures should clearly define the records management process and its \napplication to financial records.  Financial instructions, audit and accounting manuals should also reflect records management requirements.  Records management procedures should be monitored and updated on a regular basis.  The introduction of records management techniques and practices will require careful staff training.  \nThe first action is for records managers to understand the objectives of financial \nrecords management, and then be clear on the key principles of financial records care, regardless of whether the records are in paper or electronic form.  Then they can consider the criteria for an electronic records system. \nObjectives of Financial Records Management \nDeveloping and implementing a financial records management system requires clarity about its aims and objectives irrespective of whether the system is manual, electronic or mixed.  The objectives involved normally include \n                                                \n \n1 Terry Cook, \u201cElectronic Records, Paper Minds: The Revolution in Information Management and \nArchives in the Post-Custodial and Post-Modernist Era,\u201d Archives and Manuscripts  22 (November \n1994): 302.

The ", "77": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n68 records manager must ensure the following safeguards are in place to ensure \nelectronic records are protected. \n\u2022 The information in the existing financial management system must be \nwell-organised, accurate, easily accessible and sufficiently reliable to move to an \nintegrated system. \n\u2022 The integrity of the electronic records must be maintained: that is, the records \nmust be complete, accurate and verifiable. \n\u2022 Appropriate security procedures and systems (such as access restrictions/ \npermissions) must be imposed to ensure that (1) only authorised information is \ninput into the system and generated from the system and (2) only authorised individuals can access or amend records.  There must also appropriate back-up procedures and storage facilities to ensure records can be restored if necessary. \n\u2022 It must be possible to retrieve the records when needed for administrative, legal or \nhistorical purposes, and records should only be destroyed with proper authority according to records schedules.  \n\u2022 There need to be appropriate management structures in place to support the \noperation of the system, including legislation to support the legal admissibility of \nelectronic information if there is no parallel paper system.  \n\u2022 There must be adequate administrative provisions to support the ongoing \nmaintenance of the system, including financial resources, adequate physical \nconditions and sufficient staff.  For example, there must be a reliable power supply; there need to be secure backup and storage procedures and facilities; the electronic and paper records need to be stored in appropriate environmental and physically secure conditions. \n\u2022 The organisation\u2019s accounting manual will usually specify record formats for \naccounting records, and in some cases it will define rules for the handling and \ncustody of financial records.  However, accounting manuals do not normally establish standards for managing records.  Records managers need to work with officials in financial agencies to establish standards in such areas as retention periods, records formats, media, control systems and equipment.  \n\u2022 There must be an effective training programme for users and custodians of \nrecords.  \nIn addition to ensuring these standards and requirements are in place, records \nprofessionals can also help the development of the financial records system by \n\u2022 identifying records with continuing utility and enduring value \n\u2022 determining, with the stakeholders, how long valuable records need to be \nmaintained and accessible in order to meet administrative or archival requirements \n\u2022 identifying the structural and contextual information (metadata) that needs to be \ncaptured and maintained with electronic records of enduring value if they are to remain identifiable and accessible over time ", "78": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n69 \u2022 working with systems developers to ensure that electronic records can be \npreserved over time and public access provided, as specified in archival \nlegislation. \nThese issues are explored in greater depth in \nManaging Electronic Records  and Organising and \nControlling Current Records. \n \nActivity 6 \nDoes your organisation automate its financial management functions?  If so, write a \ndescription of exactly what processes are automated.  Who manages the system?  \nHow is it used?

They primarily refer to the paper inputs and outputs. \nSeries Control \nIt is important to establish control over records series from the time that they are created and to maintain control throughout their life.  Within each series, there is usually a further level of control over individual record items.  There may be, for example, serial numbered vouchers, checks or forms classified by account codes or a chronological arrangement of documents by financial years or monthly accounting periods.  \nInformation about the records series can be recorded in a register of records series \nheld in each agency.  Such a register would record essential contextual information about the series.

Each item should be clearly marked with the following information: \n\u2022 creating agency \n\u2022 series and item numbers \n\u2022 title \n\u2022 financial year \n\u2022 control number. \nA number of principles apply to the process of identifying financial records. \n1. Where more than one volume of a record is created in a financial year, each volume \nshould be given a single, sequential number (1, 2, 3, and so on), with the sequence starting again at the beginning of each financial year. \n2. The main components of financial information systems will be accounting records, \nwhich should be created and maintained as discrete record series.  \n3. Each item should be part of a clearly defined record series. \n4. Some types of financial records are retained in a general filing system.  These may \ninclude policy documents, authorities such as warrants, budget papers, tenders, contracts and project documentation.  The organisation\u2019s registry or records office should play a role in their management.  In a decentralised organisation the files may also be managed by sub-units, individual action officers or secretaries, who should take account of financial information management requirements. \n5. In order to identify records in a consistent way, file titles should use terms obtained \nfrom a master list of authorised terms.  File titles should also include the financial year and, where appropriate, the accounting code.  For example: ", "80": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n71 WARRANTS - VIREMENT - 1995/96 \n EXPENDITURE - MONITORING - 1995/96 -SUB-HEAD 021 \nArranging Financial Records \nWhere possible, records should be arranged by financial year and then by month, accounting code or control number, as appropriate.  This will greatly assist retrieval and facilitate the audit process.  Files should be arranged by file number, while file plans should provide for retention and retrieval of records by financial year, expenditure head and document type. \nDetermining Storage and Security Needs \nEquipment used for storing financial records should be capable of accommodating the variety of formats and sizes in which these records are created.  Adjustable shelving allows optimum use of floor space and shelving.  It is important that the accommodation should be secure and that doors should be locked when the storage areas are unoccupied.  \nAccounting and financial documents are frequently stored in lever arch files, binders \nand box files.  This is appropriate for current records but semi-current records should be transferred to file covers, labelled and placed in records storage boxes on open shelving.  Boxes, which are less costly, provide greater protection for documents against damage from dust, humidity, fire and water and make for easier handling, identification and processing. Lever arch files can then be recycled. \n \nActivity 7 \nHow does your organisation presently arrange its financial records?  Describe the \nprocesses followed.  Do these processes follow an established method and is that \nmethod documented?  Where?  Are people trained to arrange the records according to \nthe method chosen?  How are they trained? \nHow does your organisation physically store its financial records?  Are they stored in \nboxes, files, binders or other containers?

Records retrieved from their permanent location for operational purposes should be returned at the close of business each day. \n\u2022 When a record is removed from a record series for use outside the record creating \nunit, this use should be authorised and noted in an issue record and the movement \nrecorded in a transit or way book. \n\u2022 The movement of records should be monitored on a regular basis, and it is \nadvisable to limit the number of records that may be issued to another agency and \nthe period for which they may be retained by that agency without notification. \nProtecting the Information in Electronic Records2 \nThere are particular issues and risks associated with processing and retaining records on a computer system that are not encountered in wholly paper-based systems.  These include \n\u2022 the inadvertent destruction or corruption of electronic records \n\u2022 unauthorised tampering with electronic records \n\u2022 the possibility that electronic records and operating systems will become obsolete \nbecause of constant upgrading or changing of computer systems over time. \n                                                \n \n2 The specific auditing provisions have been adapted from Australian Taxation Office Ruling TR97/21, \nIncome tax: recordkeeping - Electronic Records, 1997, http://www.ato.gov.au ", "82": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n73 Various precautions must be in place to protect against the loss of data during a \ntemporary or permanent loss of computer facilities.  This precautions include \n\u2022 introducing a disaster recovery plan \n\u2022 regularly producing back-up copies of systems software, financial applications \nand underlying data files \n\u2022 storing back-ups together with a copy of the disaster recovery plan in an off-site \nfire safe \n\u2022 introducing arrangements with one or more organisations possessing compatible \ndata processing equipment to handle essential work in the event of a computer crashing. \nFor more information on protecting electronic \nrecords, see Managing Electronic Records. See also Preserving Records and Emergency Planning for \nRecords and Archives Services. \nManaging Forms \nForms and reports are used extensively in accounting and financial information \nsystems.  Controlling of their design, eliminating unnecessary forms and limiting the number of copies produced and distributed are essential aspects of forms management.  \nFinancial forms should be eligible for audit, legal or informational purposes, and it is \nhelpful if forms can be printed on self-carboning paper when multiple copies are required.  The use of carbon paper and separate forms results in illegible copies, particularly if these are handled by more than one person. \nThe purpose, use and distribution of financial management forms should be kept \nunder regular review.  For example, forms may be revised when changes take place in the operating environment, such as with the development of computer networks or the introduction of a new accounting system. \nMonitoring and Reviewing Records Systems \nThe financial records management system should be monitoring regularly to ensure that it is meeting its objectives cost-effectively.  Such monitoring should also identify weaknesses or areas for improvement.  Users and external auditors should be asked for feedback. \nIt is also important to monitor changes in the financial and technological \nenvironments, particularly the impact of information technology. \n ", "83": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n74 Conducting a Records Management Audit \nA records management audit should be carried out on financial records at random \nintervals two or three times a year.  The audit or inspection should check that records management procedures are understood and are being carried out consistently.  It can be undertaken more frequently where computerised accounting applications are in use and provide for audit trails.  This audit should be performed by the internal audit unit or by the records authority. \nAudits should check that 1. the financial records required by law and internal regulations are maintained and \nreadily accessible \n2. standard disposal actions have been carried out under approved disposal authorities. \nCopies of the audit report should be forwarded to the records authority and to the \naccountable head of the agency, who should be able to take responsibility for ensuring that appropriate action is taken on any recommendations made. \nThe audit report provides a basis for action where a records problem is identified.  It \nshould be particularly useful to accounting officers, who are responsible for producing and maintaining financial records, and to the head of the ministry of finance, who has broad policy responsibility for the operation of the government\u2019s financial and accounting system. \nAPPRAISING AND DISPOSING OF FINANCIAL \nRECORDS  \nDespite the introduction of computerisation, the volume of financial information and records in most organisations continues to grow.  The appropriate and timely disposal of these records is an essential aspect of managing financial records.  Disposal is also at the centre of accountability.  As Chris Hurley, a former Keeper of Public Records in Victoria, Australia, expressed it: \nThe statutory regulation of the disposal and treatment of government \nrecords is the foundation, in a democratic society, upon which all other measures of public and internal scrutiny of the affairs of government \nrest.\n3 \nThese two concerns, the reduction of records holdings and the retention of records as \nevidence in support of accountability, need to be reconciled in the disposal of financial records.  \n                                                \n \n3 Quoted in Judith Ellis, ed., Keeping Archives,  2d ed. (Australia: Thorpe, 1993),. p. 191.  ", "84": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n75 Perhaps more than other types of records, financial records are found in a range of \nrecords systems throughout an organisation.  The planning, appraisal and implementation of the disposal process requires co-operation and co-ordination throughout the organisation to ensure that audit trails and the evidential qualities of records are maintained while the volume of records is controlled.  Three key points to consider are outlined below. \n\u2022 The extensive use of forms and the practice of copying of documents in \naccounting and financial transactions leads to a high level of duplication of \nrecords.  As auditors generally require the original of a document, it is important to clearly establish which records are duplicates and which copies may be used in place of originals.  For example, is it appropriate for accounting and auditing purposes to attach supporting documents to a copy of a voucher instead of the original? \n\u2022 The period of the financial year is also a determining factor in the creation and use \nof many financial records.  This fact can be used in a positive way to assist in the \ndisposal process, to \u2018trigger\u2019 action when disposal is required. \n\u2022 Accountable documents, such as licence receipt books, are usually subject to \nfinancial regulations or instructions that provide for their handling and disposal.  \nCare needs to be taken to identify these and accommodate their accounting requirements in the records management process. \nAppraisal Criteria \nAppraisal involves determining those records worthy of ongoing retention because of their continuing utility or enduring value.  The following issues should be taken into account in the appraisal of financial records. \n\u2022 Legislation and regulations may contain requirements for the retention and \ndisposal of records.  Particularly relevant are laws relating to finance, customs and \nexcise duties, taxation, pensions, social security, employment and audit.  Also important are statutes concerning evidence and limitations on action for claims.  For example, statutes bearing on retention periods for accounting records may include the Civil Evidence Act, Value Added Tax Act, Companies Act, Consumer Protection Act, Data Protection Act, Financial Services Act and the Limitation Act. \n\u2022 Financial records may provide the creating organisation with valuable \nadministrative, legal and fiscal evidence.  A knowledge of the administrative \ncontext in which the records were created, including an understanding of financial systems and the functional relationships of records, is required for a proper assessment of these values. \n\u2022 The records may also provide valuable information of wider research interest.  For \nexample, research into political, economic and social activities has demonstrated a \nclear interest in the long-term preservation of financial records. ", "85": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n76 \u2022 The cost of retention and the availability of resources should be considered when \nappraising records.  Cost is a critical factor given the volume of many series of \nfinancial records and the technological support required for electronic records.  \n\u2022 The utility of the records must be considered.  The utility of records is dependent \non their completeness, accuracy, arrangement, physical condition and \naccessibility.  These factors are in turn linked to the quality of records management, including the maintenance and use of financial records by accounting and finance staff.  \n\u2022 Aggregate financial information may provide more information in less space than \nother records.  Financial records may comprise summaries, consolidated accounts, \nannual statements, statistics and reports.  Where aggregation has occurred, consideration should be given as to whether there is a need to retain supporting documents. \n\u2022 Financial records may be duplicated.  The duplication of transaction records is a \ncommon feature of manual or \u2018mixed\u2019 financial record-keeping systems because of the need to keep different stakeholders informed.  Duplicates should be removed from the system as soon as they are not needed. \nDeveloping Retention Schedules \nDeveloping retention schedules for financial records requires consultation with and input from key stakeholders, including the accounting authority, finance departments, the external audit body and the records authority.  Consultation also helps ensure stakeholders comply with the appropriate financial regulations or accounting instructions relating to retention periods. \nThe appraisal process usually results in the development of two kinds of schedules.  \nGeneral schedules cover financial records in common use throughout government agencies, frequently referred to as administrative or housekeeping records.  \nAdministrative records : Records relating to those \ngeneral administrative activities common to all \norganisations, such as maintenance of resources, care of \nthe physical plant or other routine office matters.  Also \nknown as housekeeping records. \nFunctional schedules relate to records created by agencies in the performance of their \nown particular function, often called operational records. \nOperational records:  Records created for the purpose \nof carrying out the core functions of an organisation.  \nAlso known as functional records. \nWhen determining schedules, the following points should be considered. ", "86": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n77 \u2022 General disposal schedules should not be overly customised.  The advantages of \nuniform retention periods for records of the same type that perform the same \nfunction are lost if those schedules are altered too significantly.  Further, it becomes more difficult to monitor the use of the schedule.  \n\u2022 The schedules should be clearly laid out and presented in language that is readily \nunderstood by non-records personnel.  After all, it is financial personnel, not \nrecords managers, who will be involved in implementing the schedules.  Terms that are familiar and in general use in accounting, audit and finance areas should be used to describe the records. \n\u2022 The contents of the schedules are arranged by financial system and by record \nclass, providing appropriate links to functions and statutory requirements. \n\u2022 \u2018Triggers\u2019 for initiating disposal action are required.  For financial records, the end \nor start of the financial year or completion of audit, or a specified number of years after those events, are convenient points in the records\u2019 life to indicate when the schedule should be applied. \n\u2022 Monitoring the application of the schedules is essential to ensure that disposal \nobjectives are achieved and that retention periods and disposal decisions are \nrelevant.  Financial policy, the regulatory framework and the accounting system should also be kept under review to enable the schedules to be updated as necessary. \n\u2022 Documentation should be kept of all records destroyed or transferred, in order to \nmaintain the audit trail and enable agencies to account for all their records. \nAppendix 1 illustrates a sample retention schedule for accounting records.  The \nexample, taken from the United Kingdom, illustrates the range and variety of accounting records that may be encountered.  The disposal periods are based upon a detailed analysis of relevant legislation, accounting practice, audit requirements and user needs.  \nEvery country has different requirements for the disposal periods, and the terms used \nto describe the records may also differ from country to country.  Nevertheless, the types of accounting records will be similar, and the list may at least provide a useful starting point in analysing retention requirements. ", "87": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n78  \nActivity 8 \nChoose one of the sections shown in the retention schedule in Appendix 1, such as \nbank account records or salaries and related records.

In the near future virtually all important government financial records will be contained in an IMFS, as electronic records, or will be generated by it, as paper outputs.  Within the next decade records managers need to come to grips with the record keeping implications of IFMS systems or the national archives will be unable to fulfil its statutory responsibility for financial records. \nIn an IFMS, one central database contains all the aggregated data and facilitates the \nflow of information between the inter-related system parts.  A transaction is entered once when it is processed, and then the information is aggregated and expressed in various reporting formats.  Information about the transaction can thus be shared throughout the system.  \nIntegrated financial systems are most commonly used for budgeting, accounting, cash \nmanagement and debt management.  As governments around the world begin to introduce integrated financial management systems, it is important that records managers should become acquainted with the concepts involved so that they can contribute to the planning process. \nThere is another significant reason why records managers and archivists should be \ninterested in IFMS systems.  An increasing proportion of financial management processes within IFMS systems are conducted in a wholly electronic environment.  Because IFMS software developed in the private sector does not meet public sector accountability requirements, it is not possible to use \u2018off the shelf\u2019 software. Instead the software must be specially designed or adapted when it is first introduced and again when it is subsequently upgraded.  \nThis need to create special software for integrated financial management makes it \nmore difficult to manage information and records.  In particular, it is more difficult to migrate information to new computer systems, since the old and new systems may not be easily compatible.  Records managers and archivists therefore have reason to be ", "97": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n88 concerned that the official record will be distorted.  This issue is explored in greater \ndepth later in this lesson in the section on electronic systems and records. \nFigure 12 below illustrates the complex nature of the relationships and information \nflows between the financial management functions, main information systems and stakeholders. \nPlannin g\nsystemMedium term\nplans, e.g. three\nyear rollin g plansAnnual bud gets\nDevelo pment ,\nrecurrent and\nrevenue\nFund release\nprocedure , e.g...\nwarrantin g\nAccountin g for\nrevenue and\nexpenditurePublic ex penditure\nreviewInformation technolo gy\nA core tool of inte gration\nReports and\nfinancial statementsAudit s ystemProject moitorin gProject\nappraisalResource\nallocation\nLiquidity\nmanagement\nExpenditure\ncontrol\nMonitorin g\n& controllin gPost even t\nreviewAccountabilit yExpenditure\nreview\nNational\neconom yInternational\ndonors\norganisationsStakeholder\ngroupsState\nenter prisesOther State\ninstitutionsGovernment\npolicyFinancial management  system boundaries\n \nFigure 12: Financial Management System Boundaries \nFrom Michael Parry, \u2018Integrated Financial Management\u2019 Training Workshop on Government \nBudgeting in Developing Countries, December 1997, p. 7. \nThere are many ways of implementing an IFMS.  No two systems will be the same.  \nSome of the major variables include \n\u2022 the number of sub-systems integrated \n\u2022 the degree of centralisation or decentralisation embedded in the design and \noperation of the system \n\u2022 the delegation of responsibility and accountability \n\u2022 the type of technological infrastructure. \nAn IFMS should be tailored to the needs of the organisational unit or group of \norganisational units for which it is developed.  The key point to grasp is that an IFMS is an electronic record keeping system.  As with other electronic record keeping systems, the records manager needs to be involved in the design stage in order to ensure that records management requirements are incorporated into the system.  ", "98": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n89 Attempts to ensure that these requirements are added later are likely to prove costly or \neven impossible.  The records manager must understand who are the stakeholders, why IFMS systems are needed, what they do and in broad terms how they work in order to make a useful contribution to the design team.  The following sections provides this necessary context. \nMAJOR STAKEHOLDERS  \nThe stakeholders in public sector financial management were discussed in Lesson 2.  Their roles in the government-wide adoption of IFMS must also be considered. \nThe Legislature \nIFMS systems make it possible to provide the legislature with improved factual information, thus enabling a better understanding of the government\u2019s choices for the allocation of resources. \nMinistry of Finance and the Accountant General\u2019s \nDepartment \nThe Accountant General, who usually reports to the ministry in charge of finance, is \nresponsible for establishing and operating the uniform chart of accounts, the single bank account and the appropriate linkages from departmental systems into the single centralised database.  He or she is responsible to the legislature for the preparation of reports that reflect the state of financial management across government.  Typically annual accounts are presented to the legislature every year, although in some countries, long delays occur before the presentation of final audited accounts.  Examples of these types of whole-of-government reports include \n\u2022 the statement of revenues and expenses, which shows the financial performance \nover the year \n\u2022 the statement of assets and liabilities, which shows the financial position at the \nend of the period \n\u2022 the statement of cash flows, which shows how government has financed its \nactivities. \nThe ministry of finance is also often responsible for public debt management.  In that \nrole, it requires information on individual loans, their terms, due dates and interest.  Using the IFMS capacity, individual transactions that service the debt can be accounted for centrally and reconciled with information about the types of loans involved. ", "99": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n90 Heads of Agencies \nMany IFMS projects decentralise responsibility and accountability for financial \nmanagement to heads of agencies.  The responsibilities are usually specified in the financial frameworks approved by the legislature and developed in policies and procedures issued by the ministry of finance.  The head of the agency can devolve responsibility to chief financial officers and individual project or programme managers.  \nAt the agency level, IFMS systems must be able to supply data to the centralised \ndatabase but still enable sufficient reporting and monitoring to ensure that the responsibilities and accountabilities are appropriately fulfilled.  Many IFMS implementations include components that are tailored to the management of departments and correspond to the central components of budget, accounting, cash management and debt management.  Sometimes departments have quite separate financial management systems, which report their transactions up to the centralised database for consolidation into whole-of-government accounts.  \nAuditor General \nThe Auditor General is responsible for reviewing and forming an opinion on the accuracy of the accounts produced by the government and its departments.  Audited financial results are usually required for every department in addition to the government's own audited financial statements that are often tabled in Parliament.  The auditor must be assured that the systems that produced the data are accurate, reliable and complete.  The issues of auditing an electronic system have given rise to a specialised branch of the audit profession known as EDP (electronic data processing) auditors.  \nInternal Auditors \nInternal auditors work with management in an IFMS to ensure that internal controls are appropriate and that the systems are operating as they are intended.  They also check that the financial information generated by the system is correct, that applicable rules and regulations are appropriate and that there is compliance.  \nIndividual Departmental Staff \nAn IFMS is about distributing responsibility and accountability for financial action out to the operating environment, where the transactions happen.  The availability of timely information reflecting status of programmes and budgets improves the capacity of individual managers to make appropriate decisions and gives them a greater degree of responsibility.  Using the IFMS as a monitoring system and a managerial tool requires significant training and sometimes adjustment.

Moreover, whereas commercial software is regularly upgraded, with the capacity to migrate data from one version to the next, IFMS systems in the public sector must be replaced by custom built systems each time there is an upgrade.

", "103": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n94 FUNCTIONS OF AN IFMS \nAn IFMS may encompass a number of sub-systems.  Exactly how many sub-systems \nare linked will vary, but the core components usually managed by sub-systems include \n\u2022 budgeting \n\u2022 accounting \n\u2022 cash management \n\u2022 debt management. \nOther components that might be integrated into an IFMS include \n\u2022 asset management \n\u2022 personnel management \n\u2022 procurement. \nEach of these components is discussed below. \nThe way the IFMS handles these individual functions is very similar to individual \ncomputerised systems described in other sections.  The main difference is that data is entered only once and then is reused as appropriate.  For example, both the personnel system and the payroll system needs to store information about staff members \u2019 names.  \nIn addition to saving staff time re-entering data, the other big advantage is to ensure that information remains consistent.  Thus if a woman marries and changes her name, in an integrated system, the name has only to be amended once.  Where the systems are separate, it is possible for one system to be updated and the other to be neglected, which can cause confusion and double reporting. \nBudgeting \nBudgeting involves planning for, implementing and evaluating policies, activities and programmes.  Budgeting can be done for the whole of government or for individual units of the larger organisation.  As a management tool, budgeting it is a way of monitoring expenditure to ensure that activities \u2018stay within budget\u2019.  Budgeting also acts as a major performance indicator of how efficiently and effectively government funds are being used. \nAn IFMS allows the organisation to formulate a budget, execute actions against that \nbudget, reprogramme activities to accommodate changes in the amount of money \navailable and evaluate the success of the budget at the end of the time.  An IFMS also allows the organisation to decentralise budgeting down to the operating areas of departments, where responsibility for delivering services and products of government is located.  Providing greater local control over budgeting is key to obtaining greater accountability for government services.  If the organisation can receive timely reports ", "104": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n95 of expenditure against budget expectations, it can manage its finances and \nperformance much more effectively.  With this degree of internal performance monitoring, it is possible to delegate authority for a greater number of tasks. \nThe budgeting component feeds into the accounting component in that the accounting \nsystem reports against the budget estimate.  The reporting capacity needs to be closely linked to budgeting to provide the type of reports required for decision making and monitoring. \nAccounting \nThe accounting component of the IFMS records and integrates the results of the individual financial transactions that occur daily, thus providing the basic data for other components of the system.  \nThe accounting system allocates financial transactions against the agreed chart of \naccounts, which is based on the budgeting process.  IFMS systems then allow comparison across agencies and programme types.  \nIn an IFMS, reporting can be ad hoc or it can be structured to produce standardised \nreports.  A fully operational IFMS allows programme managers to obtain information electronically about their programme and to structure reports to meet their own requirements.  Standardised reports such as balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flow statements can also be produced automatically at various levels of aggregation, such as by department or for the whole government.  Internal reports, such as comparison of actual expenses to budget estimates, can be fed back into the budget planning process.  These accounting reports can be updated rapidly to reflect transactions undertaken and allow informed decision making. \nCash Management \nCash management within an IFMS is about managing the flow of public sector resources in ways that minimise costs and maximise effectiveness.  This is a change from the traditional view that saw the cash management function as just involving the payment of bills.  The IFMS enables active monitoring of the cash reserves of government and helps to ensure that the resources are consolidated and managed so that they are available for distribution as required. \nA major benefit of this cash management is the capacity to produce cash flow \nprojections based on the expected receipts and expenditures.  Thus it is possible to ensure that funds are available when required and that cash is not left idle but earns appropriate interest.  \nThe cash management function is closely aligned to the budget function.  The budget \nprovides the master plan for spending.  Linked to the cash management function, the budget provides the data for the cash flow projection that then determines when and in what form money will be available for expenditure.  Certain priorities for expenditure are agreed by policy makers and authorisations for payments are assigned.  The ", "105": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n96 accounting function provides feedback to the cash management system about actual \nexpenses and what remains to be paid, as well as what has been collected.  Similarly, there is a close relationship between cash management and public debt management; the public debt system provides resources to cash management and also makes demands in terms of loan repayments. \nPublic Debt Management \nThe need to manage public debt appropriately became starkly apparent in the 1980s when many countries were thrown into crisis because of heavy and unsustainable debt burdens.  Some countries did not know how much they owed or to whom.  Debt financing is a complex issue involving multiple currencies, variable interest rates, syndicated debt (ie borrowing from a group of banks who spread the risk among several financial institutions), restructuring of debt and debt swaps.  Dealing with such complex concerns requires highly trained staff.  Significant attention was paid to this problem by the world funding bodies and various independent pieces of software to manage debt were developed. \nDebt management is a concern of the central government department responsible for \nfinancial management.  However debt management has an integral relationship with the IFMS system as it often provides the budget resources to carry out such capital intensive programmes.  Working out what money is due for repayment and when needs to be built into the budget planning and cash flow projections to ensure that funds are available and that penalties for late payment are not incurred.  The actual payment takes place in the cash management system.  The accounting function records the transactions that reduce or increase debt, reports on the debt transactions and provides consolidated reports on debt liabilities. \nOther Components of an IFMS System \nIn addition to core components, and IFMS system can have other components for related functions.  For example, personnel systems, which involve the administration of payroll or pensions, have an impact on the financial management function. Sometimes a personnel management component will be found within the IFMS.  In other cases, the personnel function will be managed separately but there will be a process for feeding appropriate information into the finance system.  Similarly, asset management systems supply data to financial systems concerning depreciation and commitment of funds.  \nThe potential scope of an IFMS is shown in Figure 14: Scope of an IFMS.

It might be government-wide, \nin which case all of the departments of state and other organisations that contribute to the government\u2019s finances would be included.  Alternately, the IFMS might serve the whole of a local authority, where it could cover the individual departments as well as the independent services.  \nIn linking the sub-systems together, the IFMS should include as a minimum \n\u2022 a uniform classification of accounts \n\u2022 an identified and cohesive legislative framework \n\u2022 a standard set of rules and definitions \n\u2022 one bank account. \nThese features are discussed in greater detail below. \nUniform Classification of Accounts \nA uniform classification of accounts, or uniform chart of accounts, ensures that \nbudgeting and accounting are co-ordinated, or that reporting is carried out against items in the budget.  This extract from a chart of accounts illustrates the principle. \n \n \nGroup\n  Account  Sub Account  \nCHECKING 1000  \n 1001 BANK \nCASH 1010 CASH \n 1050  \n 1055 MY SAVNGS #1 \n 1060 MY SAVINGS #2 \nFigure 15: Chart of Accounts", "108": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n99 This classification system will be determined by the Accountant General or the \nofficial with overall responsibility for the accounting function.  \nClassification of accounts can be developed in layers (nested) to meet the needs of \ndifferent users.  At the whole-of-government level, higher layers of aggregated data will be needed to meet the requirements of the parliament and external investors.  At the policy-making level a different layer of categorisation may be needed, and within operational levels a far greater degree of breakdown will be necessary.  As long as these categories can be aggregated up into the higher categories, the detail required can be specified to suit operational needs. \nStandard and Consistent Legislative Framework \nAny financial management system, whether paper or electronic, requires a standard and consistent legislative or regulatory framework.  Each country will have its own specific legislation that identifies the broad framework within which government agencies operate.  Such legislation identifies the responsibilities and accountabilities of the various officers of government and defines the measures of compliance.  The package of legislation that sets the framework for the operation of the system will include a number of specific laws.  \nThe legislation will define responsibilities for major financial functions such as \nbudgeting, accounting, cash management, debt management and reporting and define the types of agencies that are subject to the provisions specified.  Legislation might also address the organisation of different types of government agencies and the process of reviewing and monitoring government functions.  (This last function usually takes place in the office of the Auditor General.)  For example, it will state whether or not government-owned businesses and local government authorities are covered by audit or accountability requirements.  It will also identify key reporting requirements for the agencies covered, and it will define internal and external audit functions.  Relevant legislation might refer to the government\u2019s financial management and accountability to the public.  \nStandard Set of Rules and Definitions \nAs the information from financial management systems will be aggregated to meet different user needs, standards and rules for the development, maintenance and use of an IFMS must be set centrally so that they will apply across all the parts using the system.  International accounting standards are now being established by international bodies to allow comparisons across systems.  \nOne Bank Account \nWithin an IFMS, all transactions and monies must flow through a single bank account.  This account is usually established at the country\u2019s central bank, and all ", "109": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n100 revenue collection is consolidated into this account.  There may be any number of \nsub-accounts established for individual agencies or programmes, but the IFMS systems \u2018sweep\u2019 the sub accounts daily and aggregate the transactions into the central account.  The use of a single account enables the central finance unit of government to manage the cash for the whole entity and manage the overall finances. \nOTHER BASIC ISSUES TO CONSIDER  \nWhen analysing an IFMS, the following issues should also be considered. \nCentralisation and Decentralisation of \nResponsibilities \nMost IFMS are based on the principle that controls and standards are set centrally and \ntheir execution or operation is decentralised.  There are many ways to achieve this division between centralised and decentralised management.  Decentralising responsibility for the financial management to departmental heads and the heads of budgetary units helps them to monitor and manage more closely the finances for which they are responsible.  But with this devolution of responsibility goes greater accountability.  All parts of the government need to comply with procedures and policies related to reporting and managing performance.  \nTechnology \nTechnology has made the concept of IFMS practical to implement.  Data entry takes place at the place the transactions occur and then rolls through the various parts of the application updating accounting reports against budget estimates and aggregating across units and finally across departments, to provide a whole picture of government expenditure.  With the powerful distributed computing capacity now available, data can be fed from departments to a centralised database, which is usually located at the ministry of finance.  \nWithin the IFMS framework, there are many ways of providing the necessary \nintegration of both hardware and software.  Systems can operate as independent units, they can be centralised or they can operated in distributed database environments.  \nCentralisation and Decentralisation of Usage \nIn older systems, government agencies typically provided the central department with details of cash commitment and expenditure details along with claims for payment using paper-based forms.  This information was then keyed into the central computer ", "110": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n101 to update records.  The central agency then provided individual agencies with \nextensive paper reports from the system on their budgets, expenditure and available funds.  In newer systems, the individual departments are able to enter their own data directly into the central system.  The database is physically controlled and located with the central agency, although departments can access the data and enter their transactions into the central system via tailored computer screens.  \nDistributed Databases \nIn this technology configuration, a core system is implemented in the central finance ministry linked to \u2018feeder\u2019 databases operated by line ministries.  Because the database is distributed, different users can access it without interfering with one another.  However, the central database management system (DBMS) must periodically synchronise the scattered databases to make sure they all have consistent data. \nIndependent Units \nIn this approach, the ministry of finance allows each line ministry to design its own system, providing it meets certain standards for interfaces and reporting requirements.  The use of these standards makes it possible for the line ministries to feed information by diskette or other means into the central system operated by the ministry of finance. \nRECORDS GENERATED FROM IFMS \nBecause IFMS systems vary so much, it is not possible to identify specific types of records generated.  In general, the record-keeping requirements of the IFMS will be largely the same as the requirements for any paper based system.  Automating processes does not change the fundamental principles of what records are needed and where they are required to be kept.  \nThe information contained in a record kept in a computerised system is generally the \nsame as would be contained in a manual system.  For example, the report of the general ledger will be very similar in appearance to a \u2018traditional\u2019 general ledger report.  The main difference is that in some IFMS systems the user is given on-line information on the status of a transaction throughout the entire process.  It is claimed that that the ability of many stakeholders to easily obtain up-to-date information increases transparency and discourages corrupt practices. \nThe key to working out the record-keeping requirements in integrated financial \nmanagement systems is understanding the layers of responsibility and accountability specified in the way the system is designed and set up.  The delegation of responsibility for action and accountability will dictate where the record-keeping ", "111": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n102 responsibilities lie.  The financial management framework will identify what \nresponsibilities are delegated and to whom.  Records reflecting the conduct of the delegated responsibilities will need to be maintained at the point that the actions take place.  \nIFMS Framework Data \nThe framework (ie the basic design and structure), standards, rules, policy, procedures and manuals that surround the IFMS specify and define the system.  Therefore, it is important to preserve those records that detail the process of designing and establishing the IFMS.  Moreover, records assigning financial responsibility and accountability are crucial to working out who is authorised to conduct certain transactions.  Delegations and authorisations are critical records for the operating of a financial system, but these will often not be found in the system itself.  \nMaintaining records about the rules and assumptions built into the system will be \ncrucial.  These records include documents about accounting standards, policies and procedures.  Audit reports on the management, performance and operational aspects of the system produced by internal auditors should be kept for periods of between five to seven years.  Again, these types of records will not reside in the financial system itself. \nFramework Documents within the System \nBasic control records which provide the framework for the system operation will also need to be kept.  A key record is the uniform classification of accounts.  This determines the allocation of categories to transactions and is a critical operational control record.  \nFormal reports can be specified for the system.  The formal reports that are used as a \nbasis for decision making should be treated as records and maintained in ways that protect their integrity.  To achieve this within electronic systems can be complex, as the nature of the integrated system is such that data is constantly being updated.  Often the report needs to be \u2018frozen\u2019 or made tamper-proof.  Working out which reports need to be managed in this way can be done in conjunction with an auditor.  Any reports that are formally transmitted through a management chain would be likely to fall in this category.  All formal statements, such as the department\u2019s annual financial statements and anything which is formally audited and signed off by an auditor, would also need to comply. \nBase Transaction Data \nThe accounting component of an IFMS deals with the recording and categorisation of transactions, so it is here that the base records of the transaction are to be found.  At the initial entry level, the requirement is to record and explain all transactions in ", "112": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n103 sufficient detail that the transaction can be understood.  This will involve recording \nthe date, the amount and the character of the transaction.  The recording of initial transactions will usually take place at the budgetary unit level, and it is here that the responsibility for maintaining an adequate record of the transaction lies. \nThe process of reconciliation, which ensures that the individual entries balance with \nthe totals recorded in the system, takes place within the system.  Reconciliations of transactions usually take place at a set time: the end of the day, the end of a shift work period, weekly, monthly etc.  The transactions and the reconciliations together provide a complete picture of the financial activities for the set period.  Reconciliations occur throughout the system and may be the responsibility of the budgetary unit, the finance section of a department, or the central Ministry.  \nAggregations of transactions take place in those parts of the system that produce \nledgers, journals and financial statements.  These are summary records of the individual transactions with various degrees of specificity.  The ledger contains summary details about each transaction.  Journals record variations in the ledger.  Financial statements are summaries of the ledgers and journals reporting on financial transactions against specified categories at various time periods (such as monthly, quarterly and so on).  By studying the specification of responsibility and accountability for the system it will be possible to identify responsibility for record keeping.  It may be at the level of the budgetary unit, or may be at the level of the department. \nThe major point of record keeping in any financial system is the point of entry of data \ninto the system.  The data reflecting the transaction must explain the transaction and be accurate.  This general rule applies to any points of data entry into the IFMS.  \nAudit Trails \nAudit trails are essentially no more than a chronological log of every transaction that happens within a system.  In other words these are electronic records generated by the system that are essential for demonstrating that the system has integrity.  They ensure that transaction records the system produces are complete, accurate and authorised.  Reconstructing the path of a transaction using these trails is very time consuming, but possible.  Audit trails allow a transaction to be traced through a system forward to its ultimate destination and backwards to relevant source transactions.  More sophisticated logging techniques also record who had access to the system at a particular time, what data was viewed in addition to the normal logging, and what data was added, deleted or changed. \nEvent logging is a common computing protection technique.  In large systems, these \nlogs create very big files.  This data can easily be segregated by time chunks (daily, weekly, monthly) and stored in back up or \u2018archive\u2019 systems.  Typically these logs are not kept beyond the time it takes to audit the annual accounts. ", "113": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n104 Legal and Audit Issues \nAn IFMS is a record keeping system.  The system is consistent with the archival \nprinciple that the records of an organisation are different in quality from literary manuscripts because they arise from the regular business of an organisation.  These records have been created by staff following procedures that are reinforced by a variety of controls that ensures their completeness, accuracy and authenticity.  The archival principle of continuous custody is important because it guarantees that this system of control has not been broken.  In the world of electronic records, the traditional techniques for achieving these guarantees are harder to apply.  Auditors and lawyers are the professions that have a particular concern for ensuring that financial records complete, authentic, authorised and admissible in a court of law.  Archivists and records managers need to understand the legal and audit issues in order to ensure that the financial records generated by an IFMS meet the needs of the government, management and the public. \nThere are few precedents that address the admissibility of computer records in a court \nof law.  Where computer evidence has been submitted in legal cases the courts have taken into account expert evidence on the effectiveness of the IT control environment before assessing the reliability of the computer data.  Computerised transactions or images of documents may be inadmissible as legal evidence unless controls can be shown to be so strong as to remove reasonable doubt about the authenticity and integrity of data held by the system.  Some of these controls are recorded on paper.  It is therefore important that both the electronic records and the paper records that document the control environment are managed properly. \nBecause of the integrated nature of an IFMS (that is, data is entered once and rolls \nthrough the system according to a pre-programmed route), the controls on the system itself are critical.  To be able to verify that the information which is accumulated, aggregated or moved within the system itself, is accurate and reliable, it is essential to ensure that the system is reliable and that it is doing what it is supposed to do.  Some of the auditing controls used to verify this are \n\u2022 access controls: controls over access to the computer system by some form of \nidentity recognition, such as password, card system, personal identification \nnumber and so on \n\u2022 input and output controls: controls which ensure the accuracy and security of the \ninformation received and transmitted \n\u2022 processing controls: controls which protect and ensure the integrity of the \ninformation processed by the system \n\u2022 back-up controls: controls that guarantee the retention of back-up copies of \ncomputer files, computer programs and the recovery of computer records in case \nof system failure. \nAuditors also need assurance that the system is understood by the staff who use it and \nthat it is operating effectively.  It is essential that records are available to explain the basic aspects of the system operation, including \n\u2022 the operation of the various components of the system ", "114": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n105 \u2022 the controls built into the system \n\u2022 the flow of data from input to output \n\u2022 details of file organisation and controls \n\u2022 details of record content, context and structure \n\u2022 the program logic \n\u2022 audit trails or logs of records added, deleted and amended that relate to the system \n\u2022 disaster recovery procedures. \nRecords must be available to allow an auditor to understand: \n\u2022 the access controls on who is permitted to access and alter data \n\u2022 procedures for monitoring access \n\u2022 all changes or upgrades to the software and hardware employed \n\u2022 migration of data which may have taken place across either software or hardware \n\u2022 back-up procedures and procedures for compliance.", "115": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n106 SUMMARY  \nIntegrated financial management systems are being introduced world wide.

Read through this lesson carefully once you have completed the activity and compare your findings.", "118": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n109 LESSON 7 \nWHAT TO DO NEXT? \nThis module has examined the management of financial records.  It has addressed the \nimportance of good record keeping for efficient and effective financial management, and it has outlined the role and importance of stakeholders in financial records management.  It also explained the business functions and processes of financial management, in relation to the records generated and examined the information systems and records created by financial management functions.  It considered how to manage financial records in a mixed paper/electronic records environment and introduced the concepts involved with integrated financial management systems. \nESTABLISHING PRIORITIES FOR ACTION  \nThis module has introduced key activities in the management of current and semi-current financial records within the public sector.  But which tasks should you undertake first?  Which are high-priority and which are low?  Each institution will make different decisions based upon:  \n\u2022 the state of record-keeping systems \n\u2022 the state of preparedness and training of the records staff \n\u2022 the appropriateness of the legislative and regulatory framework \n\u2022 the government\u2019s priorities for managing the financial function. \nThe latter is particularly important \u2013 records management is there to serve the wider \npriorities of the organisation, not the other way round.  However, it is possible to offer some recommendations for action, which will help organisations manage their financial records more efficiently.  Complete the activity below then consider the suggestions offered here. \n \nActivity 11 \nBased on the work you did throughout this module, identify the priorities you would \nestablish to establish or improve the financial records management system in your \norganisation. ", "119": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n110 Priority 1: Assess the Existing Situation \nAlmost any change to the existing systems needs to be based on a solid understanding \nof functions, processes and user requirements.  It is also vital to develop a good understanding of the present state of the records.  Existing record systems should be surveyed to identify strengths and weaknesses.  This should cover \n\u2022 the legal and regulatory framework \n\u2022 organisational structures and training for records specialists \n\u2022 policies, procedures and guidelines \n\u2022 the completeness of the records inventory and retention schedules \n\u2022 vital records and disaster recovery arrangements \n\u2022 records storage \n\u2022 security of access, including physical security. \nOne of the key facts to establish is whether problems are widespread or whether they \nare concentrated in one or two administrative units.  The former would suggest problems with the overall framework in which the record system is operating; here a strategic approach may be most effective.  The latter might suggest that a more limited and focused approach would be more appropriate. \nPriority 2: Analyse the Information Flows \nAn analysis of the way information flows within the organisation and between organisations will identify unnecessary duplication, sometimes because it is simply not needed and sometimes because the activity it supports is no longer meaningful activities.  The analysis will also assist in identifying the boundaries of the record keeping system and its main stakeholders (see Lesson 4).  This is important because it is easy to define the boundaries of the system too narrowly and then run into problems later.  Lessons 3 and 4 identify the main functions, processes, information systems, records and stakeholders and may assist in this analysis.  The analysis may be represented in a simple flow chart or it may result in a much more detailed set of diagrams and descriptive text depending upon the need.  As a general rule, wholly manual systems require rather less intensive analysis because manual systems are much more tolerant of imprecision and \u2018unwritten rules\u2019 than automated systems.  The techniques outlined in the Analysing Business Systems M odule provide an \nappropriate methodology. \nPriority 3: Identify the Stakeholders and the \nOrganisation\u2019s Policy Objectives \nStakeholders will be able to provide valuable information about whether a policy is \nreally going to be implemented, whether it has had to be modified in the light of ", "120": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n111 events and whether large automation projects are being considered.  Financial \nmanagement is a dynamic area, and priorities can change rapidly.  Stakeholders (eg auditors or accountants) will also be able to provide information about problems they are experiencing or which they anticipate for the future.  For example, do they experience delays in obtaining the information they need?  Do they consult the records at all?  If not, why not?  A questionnaire can provide a useful way of gathering information it should usually be supplemented by interviews.  \nSee Restructuring Current Records Systems: A \nProcedures Manual  for a methodology for \ninformation gathering. \nIt is also important to identify the organisation\u2019s policy objectives for financial \nmanagement before determining a plan of action.  There are likely to be policy statements and planning documents on the government\u2019s objectives for the ministry of finance as well as policy documents specifically on financial management issues.  Business plans, where they exist, usually have implications for the management of finance, and this in turn has implications for the management of financial records.  For example, if the civil service changes the approach to budgeting or accounting, these will all have implications for the management of financial records.  \nFinancial management is an area that readily lends itself to computerisation.  Many \ncountries are in the process of automating processes that were hitherto largely paper based systems, or integrating hitherto separate computerised systems into integrated financial management systems.  The records manager should be in a position to support this process by providing an electronic records management service if required. \nIt is important to remember that different stakeholders will have differing and \nsometimes conflicting objectives and priorities.  If there are existing automated financial management systems, or plans to introduce them, the IT department will also be a stakeholder with its own agenda, as well as being a service provider.  \nPriority 4: Stabilise Existing Record-keeping Systems \nThe information gathering exercise should make it possible to decide where best to direct the financial records improvement programme.  It is advisable to stabilise the existing system for managing paper records as much as possible before attempting to introduce automated systems. \nOne of the most common problems in neglected records systems is that they are \ncongested with vouchers, output data, files and other records that are not required on a daily basis.  In such conditions it is almost impossible to provide the information that financial managers and auditors need. \nA significant step forward will be achieved by identifying and physically removing \nfrom the system those records that have not been used for a designated period of time which could be, for instance, ten years.  Moving the inactive records physically out of the storage areas will relieve the congestion problem.  If these records are still needed, ", "121": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n112 they must be transferred to secure, low cost storage provided by the organisation or \nmaintained as a central facility, in a systematic manner.  \nManaging Records in Record Centres  describes the \nprocess of transferring records to storage in logical \nand ordered ways. \nWhere the intent is to introduce computerisation, the phasing of the decongestion \nexercise should be timed to coincide and support the development of the electronic system.  \nOnce the inactive records are housed securely, it will be possible to restore a logical \norder to the active records.  See the manual on restructuring records systems. \nPriority 5: Plan Improvements \nHaving gathered relevant information and stabilised or repaired the existing systems, improvements can be carefully planned based on:  \n\u2022 the strengths and weaknesses of the existing system \n\u2022 how information flows within the system \n\u2022 what the main stakeholders think about the service being offered \n\u2022 what the stakeholders want to achieve in the area of financial management and \nwhat they intend to change \n\u2022 whether there are plans for automating financial management information systems \nthat will have an impact upon records management. \nAt this stage it will be possible to examine possible technological solutions to support \nthe objectives of the stakeholders and the organisation as a whole.  Although technology is important, it should come last in the planning.  \nWhen the planned improvements are finally implemented they are likely to gain \nsupport and be successful because: \n\u2022 users have been consulted \n\u2022 it is possible to demonstrate where problems are occurring and why \n\u2022 it is possible to demonstrate that the changes proposed will bring concrete benefits \nto financial management. \nPriority 6: Encourage Better Records Management \nPractices \nBefore any sustainable progress can be made, it is necessary to establish the principle \nthat all records, both paper and electronic are to be considered part of the organisation\u2019s records management regime.  This should not undermine the authority ", "122": "MANAGING FINANCIAL RECORDS  \n113 of any of the stakeholders nor contradict the rules established in the financial \ninstructions or the accounting manual.  It may be necessary to spend some time with stakeholders to explain the role of the records manager, the benefits records management can bring to an organisation and the means by which records management controls reinforce accounting and audit controls. \nTraining is essential to achieving improvements.  Senior managers need to be \nsensitised to the issues involved.  Records managers need to develop a greater understanding of financial management requirements.  Accounts staff need training in techniques for controlling the arrangement, retention, movement and storage of records.  An effective way of approaching these issues is to identify and train an accounts officer (or a team of officers) in records management skills to serve as a training officer within the accounting cadre. \nFinally, a partnership with the audit department will do much to ensure that records \nmanagement is a vital part of the government\u2019s programme for efficiency and accountability.  Auditors\u2019 work is all about records, and they readily understand the significance of records management systems.  They should be encouraged to comment where poor record keeping is harming the effectiveness of financial management systems and to raise these issues in their reports to the legislature. \nGETTING HELP \nMany institutions, particularly in countries with limited resources, have little access to resources for financial records work.

Based on this approach, we have aligned our value-creation process via specific themes that connect with LBF\u2019s operations. Our aim with this approach is to provide readers with a sound understanding of the underlying policies, frameworks, and models that form the basis of each business operation.  \nTARGET AUDIENCE AND BEYOND\nThis report is intended to fulfill the information needs of the LBF\u2019s key stakeholders - individuals or groups who have an interest that is affected or could be affected by the Company\u2019s activities. Accordingly, the report narrative has been developed to address the information needs of the key business-related stakeholders as well as other interested parties who may not necessarily have a direct connection to the business, such as the media, industry analysts, students, potential investors, etc. \nWhile the structure of this year\u2019s integrated \nreport remains largely the same as the previous years\u2019 report, we have made some changes to simplify our value creation story by summarising the interconnectivity between LBF\u2019s purpose, values, and ethical principles and the material issues of relevant stakeholders. Across the report, we have included relevant examples to illustrate how LBF is delivering stakeholder outcomes in line with the Company\u2019s core values - excellence, ethics, transparency, innovation, professionalism and quality. \nOUR INTEGRATED THINKING\nIntegrated thinking sits at the core of LBF\u2019s approach to business for we believe that as a responsible financial institution, we must focus on the triple bottom line (3Ps - people, planet and prosperity) and ensure we mobilize resources not only for the Company\u2019s prosperity but equally importantly towards safeguarding the current and future well-being of people and the planet. LBF continues to reinforce its commitment to the 3Ps by leveraging its competitive position to enhance shareholder returns over time, while at the same time working to promote socioeconomic and environmental development for the longer-term benefit of our Country. To drive our efforts, we set clear targets under each of the 3Ps accompanied by a scorecard that keeps track of our progress on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, to report on our progress more holistically, accountably, and transparently in conformity with international standards, LBF has engaged the <IR> framework promulgated by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).\nPrioritise\nstakeholdersIdentify needs ofstakeholders Formulate value propositionACCOUNTABILITYTRANSPARENCY\nGOVERNANCE\nPartners\nResources\nProcesses\n Create\n Capture\nActivities\nCost model\nRevenue model\nSharing surplus\nOutputs\nSegments\n ChannelsDeliverDe\ufb01nePROSPERITY3SUSTAINABILITYPLANET2PEOPLE1Intellectual capital   |   Financial capital   |   Manufactured capitalHuman capital   |   Social and relationship capitalNatural capital\nCREATING AND\nPRESERVING\nVALUESociety Markets\nRisk and\nopportunityTechnologyIdentifystakeholders", "15": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/2314\nT\nGA\nSTransparency\nLB Finance is highly concerned about transparency and strives to improve transparency as the basis of effective \nstakeholder engagement. In this regard, the Company obtains independent external assurance for its annual financial statements (pages 253 to 255). More recently, LBF has sought independent assurance of its ESG indicators to ensure they are in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. In this report, we are also striving to comply fully with the checklist of transparency issued by Transparency International Sri Lanka (page 424 to 426). \nGovernance\nAs per LBF\u2019s governance structure, the Board remains the highest governing body of the Company (page 213 to 214). In this capacity, the Board leads the promotion of good governance practices and provides oversight to ensure the affairs of the Company are managed in a fair, responsible, and transparent manner. The Board also sets the tone from the top to promote and enforce good business ethics at all levels of operations.\nTo support these efforts, the Board has appointed several Board committees (pages 234 to 243). All Board committees \noperate under the delegated authority of the LBF Board and in line with Board-approved terms of reference.\nLBF\u2019s commitment to good governance was recognised both locally and internationally. At the TAGS Annual Report \nAward 2022, LBF secured the Bronze in the corporate governance practices category.  And also, at the South Asian region SAFA Awards, LBF was awarded the Bronze in the same category. Accountability\nThe LBF Board is committed to clear and comprehensive financial reporting and disclosures to disseminate shareholder information. LBF\u2019s Board of Directors is accountable to stakeholders for ensuring the affairs of the Company are managed properly by applicable laws and regulations (page 15).\n Sustainability\nLBF has made a conscious effort to integrate sustainability into its day-to-day operations through its corporate sustainability strategy which is based on the 17 UN SDGs and their related targets.

We appreciate that to deliver on this promise, we must have a clear understanding of our stakeholders and their expectations. Engaging meaningfully with our various stakeholders is therefore critical.\n1\n APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nThe LBF Board recognises the impact that our stakeholders have on our \nability to create and retain value and as such promotes an inclusive approach to stakeholder engagement to ensure the Company stays connected to its stakeholders to understand their material needs, interests, and expectations. Recognising the impact that our stakeholders have on our ability to create and retain value, we remain invested in building and maintaining good relations with all our stakeholders. Our fundamental approach to stakeholder engagement is aimed at understanding their concerns and responding by taking appropriate decisions to produce value-driven outcomes. Stakeholder survey - 3rd consecutive yearMarketing Department of  University of Sri Jayewardenepura\nStakeholders are people, groups or organisations that have interests or concerns in the Company or can affect or be affected \nby LBF\u2019s actions, objectives and policies. Meeting the needs and aspirations and addressing the concerns of stakeholders is a cornerstone of the Company\u2019s strategy. All the stakeholders would relate to the Company through being concerned with its performance in one or more of the aspects such as economic, social a nd environmental. Through a continuous process of dialogue \nand consultation with stakeholders, LBF is able to comprehend their needs, aspirations and concerns and are able to formulate strategies to address them. LBF believes the only way which can assess Company\u2019s efforts are successful is to quantifiably measure stakeholder loyalty and satisfaction with the first such stakeholder satisfaction survey was done in FY 2020/21. In the year under review, LBF commissioned the research unit of the Department of Marketing - University of Sri Jayewardenepura to carry out another stakeholder satisfaction survey. With an expanded scope and larger sample size, the latest survey was designed to provide quantitative information as well as a range of qualitative indicators to measure stakeholder satisfaction towards LBF.\nExternalInternal\nConnectedEmployees\nRegulators\nCommunity\nSuppliersCustomers\nIndustry bodies GovernmentApproach to \nstakeholder \nengagementDriving shared \nvalue for \nmutual benefitStakeholder \nengagement \ncanvas\nThe key trade \noffs that we \nmanageStakeholder \nengagement \nprocessStakeholder \nmapping\nStakeholder \nissues1 3 5\n72 4\n6", "42": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/2341Eight stage stakeholder \nengagement process and \ncreating shared value\nIdentify and classify \nstakeholders \nIdentify, segment and \nprioritise stakeholders \ninto engagement \ncategories  Plan\nIdentify objectives \nand issues to be \naddressed and the \nmanner in which it will \nbe doneUnderstand\nUnderstand \nstakeholder wants \nand needs and \nhow this correlates \nwith our business\u2019 \nwants and needsInternal preparation  \nand alignment\nDesign the interaction \nand engagement plan, \nobtain internal alignment \nand the mandateBuild trust\nIdentify current and \ndesired trust levels, then \nbuild the relationship in a \nstructured manner\nStakeholder \nengagement\nEngage with each \nstakeholder according \nto the business \nobjectives\nRespond and \nimplement\nImplement the \nagreed plan \nand managing \nassociated \ndynamics\nMonitor, evaluate \nand document\nMonitor, evaluate, \ndocument and \nreport in line with \nset objectives\nStage 01\nStage 02Stage 03Stage 04 Stage 05\nStage 06\nStage 07Stage 08Customers\nSociety/\ncommunityShareholders\nBusiness partnersEmployees\nRegulatorsC\nS/CSH\nBPE\nR2\n STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS\nCompany adopts a eight point stakeholder engagement model which supports a more proactive and integrated approach to stakeholder \nengagement.

In the year under review, we undertook a deep drive to assess if our existing engagement mechanisms are serving this purpose. Our findings led to further improvements that included integrating stakeholder engagement into every step of our value-creation process. To drive these efforts at an operational level, clear goals were set for each of our key stakeholders, accompanied by value-creation indicators to gauge the effectiveness of our engagement mechanism and also measure the quality of our relationships.\n3\n DRIVING SHARED VALUE FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT\n \nAs the world accelerates its transition to a lower-carbon environment, LBF continues to explore new ways to create sustainable value.

The slump in credit demand owing to weak economic activity and high interest rates was followed by high levels of credit risk and poor market liquidity. Inflationary conditions stemming from currency pressures and the breakdown of other macroeconomic fundamentals, remain a concern even to this day.\nSTRATEGIC RESET \nThe severity of the macroeconomic challenges called for urgent action to sharpen our focus and re-engineer LBF\u2019s response in a manner that protects both the business and the interests of our customers and other stakeholders. Given the very fluid environment in the first six months of the year, the Board focused on informed risk decisions supported by stricter governance and oversight across all risk defences. \nIn parallel, we embarked on a critical \nassessment to determine the effectiveness of our current strategy and its capacity to create a conducive environment for growth, development and prosperity notwithstanding challenges. Stemming from this, the Board sanctioned a refresh of the current strategy under four key themes: business, digital, people and sustainability. This approach demonstrates the 360 degree range we intend to take in building a resilient, dynamic and future oriented business that will serve as a blueprint for the entire NBFI sector.     \nDIGITAL EMPOWERMENT    \nSince the pandemic, the financial services sector has been going through an exciting new revolution involving digital disruption. As I am sure you are aware, LBF has chosen not just to keep pace, but rather to evolve faster than the market. Striving to position LBF as an early adopter, we have systematically deepened our investment in digital domains encompassing both frontend and backend interfaces. Today our digital architecture has emerged as a core strength underpinning our ability to deliver products, services and platforms that intuitively respond to personal and business needs of customers.\nFocusing on further augmenting the \ncustomer experience in these uncertain times, we significantly improved the functionality of our signature digital product - the LB CIM mobile wallet app. Some of the new capabilities we rolled out were the CIM personal loan and the end-to-end FD transactional management feature including in-app account opening for the  first-time. With a deliberate focus on the customer, we also continued the alignment of internal processes using digital technology and data science.\nYou may recall, last year I spoke of app \ndownloads as proof of customer acceptance of the LB CIM app. However, this year we have seen incremental month-on-month growth in transaction volumes across both the financing and investing modules, which I believe is a more accurate indicator of the strong market uptake of the LB CIM app. The other important takeaway from these numbers is the seemingly insatiable appetite of the Sri Lankan customer for technology based convenience, which I have no doubt will only grow in the years to come.\nSTAKEHOLDER DELIVERABLES\nIn yet another show of its resilience, LBF produced healthy results for FY 2022/23. Buttressed by strong growth in the second half of the financial year, LBF/Company revenue grew by 42% year on year to  \nRs. 42.75 Bn, while PAT surpassed budgeted expectations to reach Rs. 8.46 Bn, only marginally less than Rs. 8.66 Bn recorded in the previous financial year.

Meanwhile, to bring more clarity and cohesion to our future endeavours, we also revamped our SDG roadmap through the introduction of a target-driven framework through which to drive our efforts over the next years. \nAWARDS AND ACCOLADES \nBeing able to win awards consistently over the years, especially in tough times, serves as a further testament to the strength of our business model and the appropriateness of our strategy. As per the latest Brand Finance ratings, LBF was ranked 24th among the top 100. It is also very gratifying to see LBF being ranked 10th as most awarded entity by LMD and also ranked 20th for most respected entity. \nFitch ratings has maintained LBF\u2019s National \nLong Term Rating of A-(lka) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) when most NBFIs and Banks being subject to downgrade.\nSUBSIDIARY OPERATIONS\nOur Subsidiaries made good progress in reinforcing their positions within their respective operating domains. LB Microfinance Myanmar Ltd, continued its strategic expansion by entering the Ayeyarwady region in Myanmar where the Company set up 02 new branches during the course of the current financial year.\nOur latest acquisition, Multi Finance PLC \nalso moved ahead with plans to consolidate core competencies to enable sustained growth.\nWAY FORWARD\nWhile I am extremely satisfied with how far LBF has come this past year, it is safe to say there is much more that needs to be done in order to achieve our vision for shared growth that will bring prosperity to people and businesses in every corner of the island.\nI am confident that the new priorities \noutlined under our refreshed strategy will ready LBF to catalyse growth ambitions in due course. Furthermore, with the IMF-EFF facility now finalised, I expect will bring an end to policy uncertainty and the start of much needed structural reforms that will redirect the Country towards sustained economic recovery in the years ahead.We are firm about caring for our island\u2019s people and our planet and take our \nresponsibilities very seriously. LBF\u2019s code of ethics, values and governance structures are all designed to responsibly manage the broader impact of our actions at all times.

With official data suggesting that the real GDP contracted by 7.8% in 2022, compared to the growth of 3.5% in 2021, it was clear that Sri Lanka had missed out on the chance to reap the benefits of the highly anticipated post-COVID revival. \nWhile most key sectors of the economy were \naffected by the crisis in some way, the SME sector appeared to be decidedly worse off. Having endured back to back stress over the past few years starting with the Easter attacks and followed by several years of pandemic induced economic woes, the SME sector seemingly reached near breaking point in 2022 with the ripple effect visible across key economic indicators such as national output, unemployment and per capita income. \nBeing the main champion of the SME sector, \nthe NBFI sector too was directly affected by the fallout. Sector-wide NPL\u2019s / stage 3 loans increased by 66.1% year on year, in sharp contrast to the 13.9% decrease registered in 2021. Despite its core leasing business thwarted by the ongoing restriction on vehicle imports, the NBFI sector demonstrated its resilience by recording robust credit expansion fuelled by a surge in gold loans which grew by 77.5% during 2022.\nTHE RIGHT MOVES,  \nAT THE RIGHT TIME \nAdmittedly much of what was happening \naround us was beyond our control. Nonetheless, unwilling to leave anything to chance, we moved quickly to take stock of the situation and right from the get go began implementing action to improve business resilience and preserve the integrity of our brand. Our goal was to be proactive rather than reactive.\nAs policy rates shot up in April 2022 by \nseven percentage points and then kept moving upward, we continuously analysed various asset classes with a view to minimise the impact of rate shocks against various rate sensitive assets. Consequently, short term assets such as the Gold Loan portfolio were strategically repriced to reflect the frequent rate revisions. On the other hand, a more broad-based approach was applied for managing long term asset positions. Quite aware of the repeated shocks that our core MSME customer base has been subject to in recent years, we felt that repricing would be counterproductive. As such, we refrained from repricing our existing auto finance book in line with rising rates, focusing instead on alternative strategies to reduce the concentration risk exposure on long term assets. In this regard, we started promoting refinance facilities mainly for short term working capital needs of existing customers, this too only among customers presenting a high credit score. We also revised internal loan-to-value ratios and tightened customer due diligence to realign our lending priorities towards high quality new exposures.\nAt the same time, we continued to maintain \na keen focus on recoveries throughout the year and with additional resources mobilised towards this endeavour we were able to comfortably achieve targeted recovery ratios. Moreover, following the conclusion of all Government-led moratoria by end December 2022, we further amplified recovery action for moratoria customers, which I am pleased to see has produced some very satisfactory outcomes. \nAs a culmination of our disciplined lending \napproaches and strong recoveries, LBF\u2019s auto finance portfolio declined by 11% on an overall basis compared to the previous year, thus ensuring portfolio exposures were contained within Board approved risk benchmarks. \nIn light of the greater restraint exercised in \nthe auto finance domain, LBF\u2019s main credit expansion strategy for the current financial year was led by Gold Loans. Capitalising on the short term nature of the Gold Loan product, we were quite aggressive in our efforts to grow the portfolio, which saw the Gold Portfolio recording robust 46% growth year on year. Bolstered by these results, LBF\u2019s captive market share in the Gold Loan space positioned at 30% during the year under review.\nEMPLOYING OUR STRENGTHS\nDelivering long-term value depends on deep \nand thoughtful engagement with the numerous \nstakeholders who represent wider society0.00.51.01.52.02.5Pro\ufb01t pe r\nEmploy ee            Rs.M n\n\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919050100150200Asset Base        Rs.B n\n\u201923\u201922\u201921 \u201920\u201919DIGITAL VERSION\nEnglish Sinhala TamilPDF versionsAUDIO VERSION\nSCAN AND LISTEN\nPLAYLIST", "69": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/2368MANAGING DIRECTOR\u2019S REVIEW\nSTRENGTHENING OUR FOOTPRINT\nIt was by far one of the most eventful years \nfor our branch network. 11 new branches were commissioned, 09 were opened in the north and east regions of the Country. A big part of our north east outreach strategy is the emphasis on increasing the level of financial inclusion in Sri Lanka.\nWith the new additions, LBF\u2019s branch \nnetworks stands at 192, one of the largest networks in the NBFI sector. \nACCELERATING DIGITAL \nTRANSFORMATION \nOur digital transformation strategy \nwitnessed a significant advancement in the current financial year marked by some important milestones that reaffirm LBF\u2019s leadership in Sri Lanka\u2019s digital financial services space. \nOur industry leading CIM Business Loan \nmobilised via the LB CIM mobile app, gained good traction and showed incremental month-on-month growth throughout FY 2022/23. Inspired by these numbers, we further expanded the digital product suite with several new innovative financing solutions rolled out on the LB CIM wallet app, among them the CIM Personal Loan specifically for salaried employees. The business loan and personal loan, being rule engine-based products, have both emerged as strong contenders to support our loan quality parameters. Equally importantly, the structural soundness and in-built recovery schematics have ensured near zero default risk for both products.I am also pleased to note the growing popularity of Gold Loan top ups, which was the very first digital financial product launched on the CIM app. Credit granted through Gold Loan tops ups exceeded all expectations in the current financial year, which I believe validates its relevance as a mainstream financial solution. \nAside from the focus on front end upgrades, \nwe continued to reform our backend architecture using the latest AI-based technology. Most notably, the credit scoring system for Gold Loans was further refined with the introduction of scientific modelling techniques to drive greater customisation in our lending approaches. Similarly, we began actively using analytical dashboards to reorient our credit evaluation and granting decisions based on more effective customer segmentation.\nNeedless to say, robotic process automation \nremained a prominent feature in our efforts to streamline internal processes and drive organisation-wide cost efficiencies. \nOUTPERFORMING EXPECTATIONS \nOur outstanding financial performance for FY 2022/23 stands testament to our willingness to engage right moves, at the right time.

PROTECTING HUMAN CAPITAL\nAs always, our people remained a great strength and in turn we continued to support them to navigate these challenging times. Recognising the inflation-induced cost pressures we rolled out various monetary incentive schemes for employees at different levels, including for new recruits on probation. \nSeeing the current economic crisis driving \nunprecedented numbers to pursue overseas employment, we took early action to prevent LBF from facing such a crisis. A highly focused talent development initiative was launched with a view to build a pipeline of multi talented employees who could potentially drive the strategic ambitions of the LBF Group in the years ahead. The programme which included special training interventions coupled with a leadership development series was specially curated for our middle management cadre.\nIn light of the ongoing economic crisis, all \nemployee engagement activities were held on a smaller scale than in the past. However, we did encourage our leaders and managers to make a conscious effort to reach out and interact with their respective teams more frequently.\nThe other major engagement activity was \nthe \u201cGreat Place to Work\u201d (GPTW) survey in 2022. While the results of the survey are still being processed, I am told that initial findings indicate a LBF stands out for high levels of employee motivation and satisfaction. Nonetheless, unwilling to leave anything to chance, we moved quickly to take stock \nof the situation and right from the get go began implementing action to improve business resilience and preserve the integrity of our brand.

That said, I believe LBF will operate from a position of strength, not only because of our overwhelming success this past year, but also because of our commitment to deliver on our promise of shared value creation. As we journey onward, we will remain firmly anchored to the core foundational principles - customer affinity, prudent lending, and digital augmentation coupled with robust risk management and oversight, which together have proven to be an unbeatable combination for assured success.

In developing our strategy, it is imperative \nthat we understand the implications of these potential trade-offs in order to make the right decision that maximise positive outcomes and minimise negative impacts. We outline below, two of the many strategic trade-offs we grappled during the year;\nCore business and growth opportunities \nOur fundamental strategy is to augment top-line revenue growth \n(financial capital) by seeking out new opportunities in new markets; new products, services and strategic partnerships. However, in 2022/23 our ability to promote our products was affected by low credit appetite on the back of the economic crisis in the country. With the SME sector being the most overly affected by the crisis, activity at branches declined. Responding to this situation, we increased our digital product suite to give customers fast and more cost-effective solutions such as the gold loan top-ups, CIM business loan, and CIM personal loan, all of which can be activated remotely without the need for a branch visit. At the same time, we also focused on strengthening customer relationships through more focused engagement. These efforts have helped to bolster LBF\u2019s social and relationship capital. Pioneering new propositions and digital-first business\nThe provision of financial services continues to shift towards digital \ninterfaces (including end-to-end processes), a trend that adversely impacts the consumption of physical touch-points (manufactured capital) and also reduced the need for employee involvement (human capital). On the other hand, increased digitisation has helped to improve process efficiency and reduce costs (financial capital) while also improving service delivery and better customer satisfaction (social and relationship capital). \nTo offset the negative impacts on manufactured capital, we are \nlooking at streamlining our branch administration model to create cost-effective branches while investing in training employees to be able to undertake multi-tasking so that they may be redeployed elsewhere across organisation thereby strengthening value created for our human capital.UNPACKING OUR STRATEGY \n 6\n OUR STRATEGIC PROMISE\nPromise to LBF Promise to customers Promise to society\nShared identity\n Individually responsible for our organisation\u2019s success\n Stronger together, than the sum of our individual parts\n Embrace individual uniqueness  and diversity\n Transformed and diverse workforce\nCommon purpose\n Each colleague has a role in achieving our purpose\n Bringing to life the \u2018art of the possible\u2019\n People united in serving customers and humanity\nMeaningful experiences\n Actively promote learning and growth\n Create organisation-wide development opportunities\n Enabled working environmentsCaring\n We genuinely care about the communities we serve\n We will form a strong bond with our customers\nConnected\n We will understand and anticipate our customer\u2019s needs and aspirations\n We will empower our customers to make their future better\n We will provide integrated solutions that address customer needs\nSimple, but not basic\n We will deliver seamless service to our customers\n We will create solutions that continuously aim to make our customers\u2019 lives better and easier\n We will make financial services possible anytime and anywhereContributing and empowering \n We will provide leadership regarding the development of new and innovative solutions to societal challenges\n We will aim to promote inclusive growth in the societies in which we operate\n We will contribute by caring for our environment and by helping others to do the same\nDo the best for people and \nplanet\nWe will test our decisions against \nthe promise of:\n \u2018Best\u2019 as the most desirable and sustained standard\n \u2018People\u2019 are individuals, communities and society\n \u2018Planet\u2019 is the natural environment", "100": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/2399BUSINESS REVIEW\nINVESTING\nOUR STRATEGY\nOur strategy is based on offering customers the \nbest in-class deposit and savings solutions that will allow them to make optimal use of market opportunities to enhance their financial capacity.

This was the selling proposition get new depositors at lower rates. Our Company is mostly funded through deposit products. Our primary source of funds comes from savings and fixed deposits. Expansion and development are impossible without first establishing and then sustaining a solid foundation of deposits. Due to our renowned brand and the trust our customers have in us, we have one of the biggest deposit bases among LFCs in Sri Lanka. The stability of our corporate brand and the variety of our branch locations are two of the main reasons why our customers have trust in our business. We also made the strategic choice to shift away from relying only on fixed deposits in order to increase our savings base. Taking into consideration the rising market interest rates, LBF made a concerted efforts to enable customers to access a wide range of options that satisfy their financial objectives, be it  short term gain or long term resilience.\n%\n01020304050Trustworthiness of \nCompany\nStrongly satis\ufb01ed\nSatis\ufb01ed\nModerate\nDissatis\ufb01ed\nStrongly dissatis\ufb01ed%\n0102030405060Friendliness in Service\nStrongly satis\ufb01ed\nSatis\ufb01ed\nModerate\nDissatis\ufb01ed\nStrongly dissatis\ufb01ed%\n0510152025303540Attractiveness of Interest Rate \nStrongly satis\ufb01ed\nSatis\ufb01ed\nModerate\nDissatis\ufb01ed\nStrongly dissatis\ufb01edMarketing Department of  \nUniversity of Sri Jayewardenepura\nSurvey Insights by", "101": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23100CORE COMPETENCIES STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS\n A diverse range of highly \ncustomer-centric innovative products\n Convenient process for deposit account opening at any branch\n Account opening and operating through CIM Highest security\n Best return on the investment\n Strong operational performance including efficiency, revenue growth and returns\n Excellent customer service and advice\n Customer satisfaction and enhance service standards\n Best practice safety measures for customer wellbeing\nProduct offerings\nDEPOSITS\nOffering competitive interest rates and a broad range of tenure options, LBF\u2019s term deposits cater to all segments of the market.

Given the instinctive reaction of customers to shop for the best possible rates, LBF was compelled to reprice its deposit portfolio several times to remain competitive and retain its customer base. As part of the overall customer retention strategy, several new tenure options (50, 150, 330 days as well as 5 and 8 months) were also introduced.  A combination of these efforts saw LBF recording a 79% FD retention ratio on average basis in the financial year 2022/23, a commendable achievement amidst the highly competitive environment that prevailed in the current year.\nRefer Risk Management Report \non page 370Impact on LBF\u2019s Risk Profile\nLiquidity Risk (H)BUSINESS REVIEW\nINVESTING\n97%\nFixed Deposits\nSavings DepositsDeposit Base Mix\n3%Savings Deposits Base Rs.Mn\n05001000150020002500300035004000\n\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919\nFixed Deposit Base Rs.Mn\n020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000\n\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919\n", "102": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23101Meanwhile, ever mindful of the need to \nregulate the asset and liability mismatch, LBF\u2019s deposit mobilisation activities focused largely on attracting shorter tenure deposits. The strategy was tremendously successful as evidenced by the robust growth in the 50 / 100 /150 days and the 5 / 8-month schemes. Moreover, in a bid to diversify the portfolio risk as much as possible, it was decided to shed high-cost large deposits and drive growth through smaller ticket deposits. Aggressive promotional activities by branch teams to mobilise smaller ticket deposits saw LBF\u2019s deposit customer base as well as the number of deposit accounts showing a twofold increase compared to the previous year.\nIn yet another significant achievement the \nnumber of deposits made via the LB CIM app hit a record high following the rollout of the fully functional FD platform on the app. \nAlthough deposit flows slowed noticeably \nfrom December 2022 onwards following the enactment of the CBSL Directive on WHT and advance income tax on interest-bearing deposits, the steady inflow in deposits earlier in the year resulted in LBF recording the highest-ever deposit volumes in the current financial year. Furthermore, bolstered by strong growth in the first three quarters, LBF\u2019s fixed deposit portfolio crossed the historic Rs. 100 billion landmark in October 2022. The fixed deposit portfolio by the end of March 2023 was Rs. 111.46 billion, a remarkable 31% above the Rs. 85.31 billion was recorded at the end of the previous financial year. \nFUTURE PROSPECTS\nFollowing the unexpected growth spurt experienced in the financial year 2022/23, the demand for fixed deposits will likely slow down considerably in the year ahead as interest rates gradually stabilise. LBF for its part will remain vigilant of these developments and take appropriate actions to consolidate its fixed deposit portfolio to balance the maturity mismatch while achieving optimal cost of funds.SAVINGS\nStrategy and performance\nSeveral factors were responsible for the weak demand for Savings in the current financial year, key among them was the high-rate environment which prompted investors to seek out more lucrative alternatives. The deterioration in disposable incomes owing to high inflation and the new tax regime also harmed the proclivity to build up the Savings portfolio.   \nChallenged by such circumstances beyond \nits control, LBF worked on multiple fonts to retain existing Savings customers. Traditional mechanisms such as the daily cash collection process were further strengthened in a bid to boost savings volumes. The LB CIM app was also used to encourage customers to maintain minimum balances in their Savings accounts in return for concessionary rates and access to value-added services. The strategy has proven to be the most cost-effective way to mobilise savings, especially given the minimum staff deployment. \nThe new customer acquisition was \nspearheaded by the cross-selling strategy to offer end-to-end financial solutions. \nDespite these efforts, however, LBF\u2019s \noverall Savings portfolio witnessed a marked decline compared to the previous year. The split between Savings and Term deposits also changed, with Savings accounting for only 3% of the total deposit base.\nFUTURE PROSPECTS\nHaving experienced some notable success in mobilising Savings through the LB CIM app, the focus going forward would be to look for ways to further expand the use of this channel to increase the Savings customer base.15.81%11.87%1.10%\n44.93%26.28%\nRs 5000 - 100,000  \nRs 100,001 - 500,000  Rs 500,001 - 1,000,000  Rs 1,000,001 - 5,000,000  Above Rs. 5,000,000  Amount wise FD mix\n56.5%\nSouthernCentralNorth WesternNorthernSabaragamuwaNorth CentralEasternUvaWesternProvince wise FD base\n9.00%\n9.00%\n6.11%\n4.61%\n4.32%\n3.93%\n3.79%\n2.74%48.55%25.60%\n15.64%10.21%\n1-6 months\n7-12 months13-24 months25-60 monthsTenure wise FD mix\n Rising interest rates\n Intense competition\n Time to time fiscal policy changesKey Macro-Economic challengesDeposit Renewal Ratio %\n020406080100\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22\nJan-23\nMar-23", "103": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23102Short term\nDigitalisation of deposit products \nunder the LB CIM digital walletMedium term\nExplore alternative channels to \non-board customersLong term\nInteractive digital platform to \nfacilitate real time customer engagementBUILDING FOR FUTURE\nObjectives and Goals\nRelated strategic focus\nRelated material driversRelated stakeholdersSDGs impact\nCBSF BO BS\nITS HPT ITS\nC C SHIG IG IG\nCBI CEC LRC\nSH SH E S/CBUSINESS REVIEW\nINVESTING\nCustomer awareness", "104": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23103FINANCING \nOUR STRATEGY\nLBF\u2019s financing strategy is aligned to the Company \nstrategy. The consistent execution of our strategy is moving us closer to our long term, medium-term and short-term aspiration to be the leading lending solution provider in Sri Lanka. We always focus our strategy to enhance lending portfolio targeting both personal and business segments. Our Financing strategy typically revolves around  our lending activities, namely leasing, mortgage loans, gold loans and other credit facilities.\nMANAGEMENT APPROACH \nThrough a risk-based pricing structure \ndependent on the creditworthiness of customers, we were able to increase loan volumes while maintaining a high-quality portfolio. Our lending approach was intended to be a driver of economic growth and social progress beyond just generating profits for our business. In an effort to increase awareness of our financing options and secure new customers, we have launched a number of advertising efforts. The acute economic uncertainties that weakened corporate prospects and personal incomes were a major factor in LBF\u2019s financing strategy. In light of this situation, LBF took a cautious approach to increasing access to credit. The paradigm of selective lending, which attempted to preserve credit quality over the long term, served as the foundation for this strategy. The foundation of our business approach to encourage long-term growth is our \u201cresponsible lending\u201d philosophy. At every point in the lending process, from the first loan offer to the ongoing review of the loan, responsible lending standards are used. These procedures are based on regular assessments of what customers want and how satisfied they are with current offerings. Our marketing team\u2019s abilities were fine-tuned via a series of training sessions. We were able to shorten delivery times and boost support for our customers as a result.\n%\n01020304050Accessibility to the \nBranches  \nStrongly satis\ufb01ed\nSatis\ufb01ed\nModerate\nDissatis\ufb01ed\nStrongly dissatis\ufb01ed%\n01020304050Ease in Documentation\nStrongly satis\ufb01ed\nSatis\ufb01ed\nModerate\nDissatis\ufb01ed\nStrongly dissatis\ufb01ed%\n0102030405060Supportivenessof the Sta\ufb00 \nStrongly satis\ufb01ed\nSatis\ufb01ed\nModerate\nDissatis\ufb01ed\nStrongly dissatis\ufb01edMarketing Department of  \nUniversity of Sri Jayewardenepura\nSurvey Insights by", "105": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23104BUSINESS REVIEW\nCORE COMPETENCIES STAKEHOLDERS EXPECTATIONS\n A diverse product suite to cater \nto all customer segments\n Flexible and tailored solutions to match customer needs\n Robust multi channel environment for convenient access\n Best-in-class service that includes guaranteed quick turnaround times and continuous support Speed of delivery\n Innovate new products and operational processes to improve efficiency\n Cost-effective, convenient, and innovative financial services\n Enforcing processes, practices, and controls to comply with all applicable rules and regulations\n Customer education and building relationships\n New products enabled by the Company\u2019s digitisation strategy\nProduct offerings\nBUSINESS PERFORMANCEFINANCING\nLEASING\nReduced by  \n17%PERSONAL LOAN\nReduced by  \n8%VEHICLE LOAN\nGrew by  \n3%CIM BUSINESS LOAN\nGrew by  \n28%\nPOWER DRAFT\nReduced by   \n16%Product Concentration\n23%\n7%\n17%\n46%2%5%\n Lease  \n Gold Loans  Vehicle Loans \n31%\n34%18%9%2%6%2023\n2022\nPower Drafts \nMortgage LoansOther     \nCustomer awarenessGOLD LOAN\nGrew by  \n46%", "106": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23105Auto Finance Rs.Bn\n01020304050607080\n\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919\nExcluding moratoria customers, healthy \nrecovery ratios were reported throughout the year which helped to further strengthen the quality of the Leasing & Auto Finance portfolio.

Targeted customer acquisition and retention strategies were deployed throughout the year.  The advance quota on all Gold Loan products was revised several times to capture the upward movement in world gold prices and allow customers to automatically benefit from the net value gain for their gold items. \nBoth ATL and BTL activities were intensified \nwith year-round press and electronic publicity accompanied by flyer campaigns, mega campaigns, and localised pocket Looking ahead, we will focus on:\n Rising interest rates\n Ongoing tightening of LTV rules\n Increased taxes and low disposable income\n Additional regulatory controls to restrict import of vehiclesKey Macro-Economic challengesAUTO FINANCE\nStrategy and performance\nAmidst the backdrop of another challenging year, LBF\u2019s Leasing & Auto Finance business stayed on track to deliver satisfactory performance considering the muted credit appetite and other challenges encountered in FY 2022/23. \nWith turbulent economic conditions in \n2022 on top of rising interest rates, high inflation induced by the LKR devaluation against the USD and Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign rating downgrade, causing credit demand to weaken considerably in the current financial year, LBF revisited its lending approaches to minimise the risk against various asset classes. Direct lending activities were largely curtailed. Refinance facilities were offered to existing customers who were adversely affected by the economic environment, to enable them to extend their repayment period and benefit from a smaller instalment. Mindful not to add to the customers\u2019 financial burden in these challenging times, LBF ensured all refinance facilities were competitively priced. \nShort-term sub loans were also offered \nto selected customers against existing facilities. Concerning new customer acquisition targeted short-term working capital loans and education loans were granted on a selective basis. Capitalising on the high vehicle prices following the rupee devaluation, LBF further seized the opportunity to penetrate new market segments to promote auto finance solutions.\nTestifying the success of the aforementioned \nprudent lending approaches, the Company registered a decline in new volumes compared to the previous financial year. \nIn the meantime, the focus on recoveries \nwas intensified with branch teams engaging proactively with customers to ensure timely collections. Recovery activities for certain customer segments were hindered owing to the moratorium that was in place for much of the year. ", "107": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23106campaigns conducted by LBF\u2019s island-wide \nbranch network. A notable feature of these campaigns was the emphasis on promoting the Gold Loan top-up facility in the LB CIM mobile app. Awareness-building activities undertaken by the propaganda vehicle were also further accelerated with special emphasis on tapping into new and untapped market segments, especially in the north and east regions of the Country. To support the market development activities, over 15 training sessions were conducted to enhance staff skills.  \nA culmination of these efforts led to \nincremental growth in LBF\u2019s average monthly granting volumes. Consequently, total granting volumes reported for the financial year 2022/23 were 56% higher than the figures reported in the previous financial year. Supported by robust granting volumes, the total Gold Loan portfolio registered a solid 45.6% growth year on year. On this basis, LBF\u2019s captive market share in the Gold Loan space is 30% as at December 2022. \nStringent customer due diligence coupled \nwith aggressive post-disbursement follow-up by the call centre and recovery action by branch teams ensured portfolio quality was well managed throughout the current year.\nFuture prospects\nGoing forward, LBF will look to consolidate the success achieved in the Gold Loan business. This would mean strengthening its reach in existing market segments while cautiously venturing into yet untapped segments to sustain a solid growth momentum over time. Hand in hand with these efforts, more stringent recovery measures will need to be deployed to safeguard long-term portfolio health.MICRO \u2013 LEASING\nStrategy and performance\nThe micro-leasing business experienced yet another stressful year as the demand for three-wheelers remained static owing to the combined impact of prolonged import restrictions, muted economic activity, and high-interest rates. In response, LBF tightened its lending limits to moderate the portfolio risk, with approval for new lending granted very selectively, supported by strict due diligence to determine customer credibility and long-term repayment capacity. On this basis, new lending volumes for the financial year 2022/23 declined substantially compared to the previous financial year. \nLBF continued to offer various relief \nmeasures to existing customers facing difficulties due to the current economic conditions, including offering reschedulement solutions and refinance options to enable them to service their obligations sustainably. These were accompanied by the introduction of new payment channels for the greater convenience of customers. These efforts helped to contain NPLs within acceptable limits, with no significant deterioration in portfolio quality recorded in the current financial year.\nFuture prospects\nIt is hoped that greater economic stability in the medium would pave the way for market corrections to take place, thus creating a more conducive environment for lending. In the meantime, the near-term focus will remain on effective NPL management to ensure the long-term health of the micro leasing portfolio.Micro Leasing Portfolio Rs.Mn\n05,00010,00015,00020,000\nThree wheeler unregistered  \nThree wheeler registered  Motor bicycles\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919\n94%\nThree wheeler unregisteredThree wheeler registeredMotor bicyclesMicro Leasing Customer Base Composition\n3% 3%BUSINESS REVIEW\nFINANCING\nLooking ahead, we will focus on:\n Movements in world gold prices\n Tough competition in the marketKey Macro-Economic challengesGold Loan Portfolio Growth\n1020304050%\n\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919\n", "108": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23107PERSONAL LOANS\nStrategy and Performance\nIt was another critical year for LBF\u2019s Personal \nLoan operation as the Company\u2019s key personal loan product - the \u201cKruthahastha\u2019\u2019 Pension Loan gained further traction among its target market. Being the only such product offered by the NBFI sector, the \u201cKruthahastha\u2019\u2019 Pension Loan competes with similar products offered by the banks. However, the unique value-added features offered through the LB CIM wallet app together with faster service delivery give the \u201cKruthahastha\u2019\u2019 product a considerable competitive edge, which has made it a popular choice in the market. \nThe demand for LBF\u2019s \u201cKruthahastha\u2019\u2019 \nPension Loan declined noticeably in the current financial year as inflationary conditions brought pressure on disposable incomes. High-interest rates also proved to be a deterrent for customers to take out new facilities.\nUnwilling to add to the financial strain \nof customers during these challenging times, LBF redirected efforts to promote refinancing to enable existing customers to stretch their payment commitments over a longer period, thereby increasing the monthly net take-home component. Internal processes were also further streamlined to improve overall processing efficiency and reduce end-to-end lead times. \nDespite the reduction in new volumes, the \noverall portfolio remained more or less on par with the previous year as customer tendency for early settlement also reduced owing to the high-interest rates.\nPersonal Loan Portfolio Rs.Mn\n01,0002,0003,0004,0005,000\n\u201923 \u201922 \u201921 \u201920 \u201919Future prospects\nA more stable environment, encompassing reduced interest rates and lower baseline inflation will be vital for driving volumes in the coming years. \nMORTGAGE LOAN\nStrategy and performance\nThe Mortgage Loan business which relies heavily on local construction sector dynamics, found itself under stress as construction activity came to a standstill owing to the scarcity of construction materials following the government restriction on imports. The deterioration in disposable incomes due to inflationary conditions was another major factor for the construction sector downturn experienced in the current financial year. \nFaced with these challenges, LBF varied the \nschematics of the Conventional Mortgage Loan proposition to explore alternative opportunities in the market. An aggressive social media campaign was part of the overall approach to building awareness regarding the new scope of the mortgage loan offer. Similarly, leveraging the exchange rate differential following the LKR devaluation against the USD, the \u201cMul Gala\u201d product was also revamped to enable LBF to tap into new customer segments. A focused social media campaign was also launched to promote the housing loan product to foreign income earners, mainly Sri Lankans working overseas. The campaign generated strong interest and is expected to be a key growth driver going forward.\nDespite these efforts, however, granting \nvolumes fell significantly compared to the previous year. \nMeanwhile, the overall Mortgage Loan \nportfolio as of 31st March 2023 reflected a 17.5% decline compared to the previous year. The reduction in portfolio value is attributed to the dual impact of lower granting volumes and healthy recovery ratios throughout the year.Future prospects\nThe main focus for the future would be to further improve the scalability of the Mortgage Loan proposition to enable LBF to seamlessly reorient to new market opportunities as and when they emerge.\nFACTORING\nStrategy and performance\nAs was the case for the past few years, LBF\u2019s Factoring operation continued at a subdued pace in the FY 2022/23 as well. With the economic slowdown affecting a majority of the Company\u2019s Factoring customer base, recovery action was further intensified in the current financial year. It was also decided that a broader strategic approach was needed to improve collections ratios and mitigate default risk associated with the Factoring portfolio.

Total money transfer volumes recorded by LBF\u2019s Western Union channel increased by 51% while the number of transactions grew by 23% compared to the previous year, both commendable achievements at a time when inward remittances flow to the country declined by as much as 31% year-on-year. Bolstered by the year-round improvement in volumes, LBF\u2019s market share also increased to 12% in the current financial year. \nThese results are attributed to aggressive \nmarketing and awareness-building activities by branch teams coupled with the progressive expansion of the sub-agent network throughout the year. Capitalising on its status as a principal agent of the Western Union money transfer network, LBF expedited the appointment of new sub-agents, which saw the network doubling from 90 at the start of the current financial year to 180 on 31st March 2023. The LB CIM Business Loan team was also mobilised to engage in cross-selling to raise awareness regarding LBF\u2019s money transfer facility. \nFuture Prospects\nThe main focus for the future would be to expand the sub-agent network in order to support the incremental growth in the number and volume of money transfer transactions.

This was driven by a sharp increase in market interest rates from the first half of the financial year inline with the tightening monetary policies imposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

This is evident from the allocation of an impairment charge amounting to Rs. 545.74 million, which marks a 46.81% reduction from the prior-year impairment charge of Rs. 1,025.98 million. In particular, the impairment charge related to loans and receivables reflected a decline of 24.81%, or Rs. 242.15 million, to reach Rs. 733.73 million. This decline can be attributed to, change in the lending product mix, improved credit underwriting and  robust recoveries, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions.\nThe management of LBF has been vigilant \nin overseeing credit monitoring while simultaneously managing credit risk and striving to enhance the quality of assets by efficiently managing and recovering finance receivables. The result of these efforts is reflected in the lower level of non-performing advances (NPA) and better management of the loan portfolio.

The relatively low gross NPL ratio showcases the Company\u2019s ability to manage and mitigate credit risk, while the negative net non-performing loan ratio implies that the Company has fully provided for the non-performing loans it has accumulated.

LB has been one of the best-performing companies in the industry, as it is emphasised that the optimum utilisation of capital is essential for creating value over time, pursuing sustainability and providing healthy returns to investors.

Additionally, the market capitalisation of the CSE grew from Rs. 3,826.50 billion to Rs. 3,903.54 billion, signifying a 2.01% rise. However, contrasting this upward trend, the S&P SL 20 index, which monitors the performance of prominent blue-chip companies, faced a decline, decreasing from 3,031.16 points on 31 March 2022, to 2,682.83 points on 31 March 2023, resulting in a substantial 11.49% drop. Moreover, the number of listed companies experienced a setback, diminishing from 296 at the end of 2021/22 to 289 by the end of 2022/23. The reduction in the number of listed companies can be attributed to multiple factors, including the adverse macroeconomic conditions, political instability and the shortage of foreign exchange throughout the financial year. Nevertheless, the upward movement of the ASPI index suggest an encouraging trajectory for the economy and demonstrates businesses\u2019 optimism regarding the future.   \n    \nPerformance of Diversified \nFinancial Sector and LBF\nAlong with ASPI and S&P SL 20 indices,  \nLBF market turnover also followed the same trend during the first three quarters of the financial year.

Based on these findings, each year we invest in relocating / upgrading facilities at our branches. At the same time, we have begun modernising the internal layout and external fa\u00e7ade of our branches to reflect greater uniformity and clarity across the network. Alongside these efforts, we have launched a widespread digitalisation strategy to transform selected branches into fully equipped digital hubs. This also connects to our overall IT strategy, where we look to leverage on the latest digital technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of internal processes in order to deliver a seamless customer experience every time.Over the years we have continued to invest in developing and strengthening our manufactured capital in order to improve LBF\u2019s competitive positioning in the market, which we hope will pave the way for LBF to grow captive market share in all key customer markets.\nBeing a large financial institution, LBF has the flexibility and expertise to customise its channel architecture in tandem with customers\u2019 behaviour.

Today our conventional branch channel works in parallel to serve existing customers and attract new customers from all markets across Sri Lanka.\n2\n BUILDING A DISTINCTIVE \nPHYSICAL PRESENCE \nIn the past decade, LBF has undertaken \nsubstantial investments to develop a solid branch footprint across Sri Lanka. Our decision to invest in branches is a strategic one, that reflects our desire to bring prosperity to a wider cross-section of the country\u2019s population. Our decision to establish new branches or even relocate branches within a particular area are influenced by a variety of factors, such as population density, financial literacy levels, key industries operating in the area, the long-term business potential of the region, educational metrics, etc. \nIn 2022, LBF accelerated its branch \nexpansion strategy to penetrate new territories in the Northern and Eastern provinces where a total of 9 new branches were opened during the course of the current financial year. With these latest additions to the network, LBF now boasts one of the most expansive and geographically widespread branch networks among all financial institutions in Sri Lanka. In line with our strategy to optimise the reach and accessibility provided by our branches, 5 existing branches were relocated in the current financial year. \nAs of 31st March 2023, LBF\u2019s branch network consisted of 192 fully-fledged branches, all \nequipped to offer the entire gamut of financial products and services including access to digital services. Since unveiling the concept of premier branches to offer a range of tailor-made services for discerning customer segments, LBF has continued to make good headway in reinforcing its bespoke solutions via the premier branch network which now stands at 3.\nWestern Central Eastern\nBranches 82 17 25\nEmployees 1,964 307 280\nPopulation 2022 (\u2018000) 5,851 2,572 1,555\nGDP 2021 (Rs.

As always these efforts were accompanied by more focused training interventions to reinforce staff commitment to service excellence. \n4\n REGIONAL PRESENCE\nLBF\u2019s presence in the wider Asian region is represented by LB Microfinance Myanmar Company (LBMM). Since its incorporation in 2017, LBMM has made good headway in establishing its presence and propagating its unique brand of microfinance solutions to customers in the Bago, Magway and Ayeyarwady regions of Myanmar. Today, LBMM has a network of 14 branches through which it serves over 25,000 customers in these territories.\nMagway\nBago\nAyeyarwadyRefer page 114As our primary interface for accessing our \nfinancial services, the LB CIM (Cash-In-Mobile) app enables retail customers to access a variety of financial services.  Meanwhile, the LB CIM business application is built with a very high degree of integration with our core banking system to create a seamless omnichannel environment through which customers can access their leases, loans, and deposit accounts from a single digital platform without being interrupted.\n5\n RESOURCE UTILISATION\nIndustry-leading digital channels  \nIn 2019, LBF took the local financial services \nindustry by storm with the launch of the LB CIM (Cash-In-Mobile) wallet application to become one of the few NBFIs to venture into the delivery of financial products in the digital space. \nThe first product introduced through the \nCIM app was the gold loan digital top-up, which has shown a continuous increase in customer uptake since its launch in 2021. The CIM business loan and the CIM personal loan, both launched in 2022 have also gained good traction, testifying to the CIM app\u2019s ability to drive customer reach and access.Efficiency improvements and  \ncost control\nCost control has always remained a key consideration in LBF\u2019s efforts to build an effective manufactured capital base. While proceeding with our expansion plans for the financial year 2022/23, we did so with extreme caution owing to the rapid inflation-induced cost increases seen in 2022. Accordingly, baseline cost structures for branch commissioning were revised to factor in an additional allowance for inflation and this was accompanied by stringent monitoring to ensure actual costs do not exceed the new baseline parameters. \nStrict cost containment measures were \nenforced to curb Avondale\u2019s operational costs. In this regard, the branch upgrade program was temporarily suspended with only mandatory maintenance work carried out across the branch network.   \nRajagiriya branch Trinco city branch Aluthmawatha branch", "145": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23144Best practice \ndigital marketing Unique digital experiences for \ndifferent customer segmentsCreating distinctive digital \ncustomer experience\nRelevant and valued engagements\nCreating lasting relationshipsEnabling new markets\nEnable digital communitiesMass adoption\nLeading rapid \ndevelopment\nBuilding a strong commercial digital business\nSecure \u2018Always on\u2019  \n(24/7) reliable service\nDigital relationship at centre \nof customer relationship\nLB CIM wallet is a multi-faceted digital banking solution offered in the form of a smartphone app, built with ultra-simple UI/ UX and trilingual functionality to cater to all communities in Sri Lanka.

In this regard, our HR policy specifies that at least 90% of branch staffing needs must be met by the local community. \nFor more specialised skills, we often \nheadhunt the best-in-class talent in these fields.\nIn the year under review, mainstream \nrecruitments were kept to a minimum owing to the prevailing economic uncertainty with only a few selected new recruitments made to fill specialised skill gaps created by labour migration. On this basis, LBF recruited a total of 1,281 new employees in the current financial year.\nTalent retention  \nAlthough LBF\u2019s labour attrition rate did not reflect any major deviation from the past years, seeing as how the Country as a whole was witnessing high numbers pursuing overseas employment opportunities amidst the worsening economic situation, talent retention was deemed a top priority for LBF in the current financial year. As a first step, the orientation program for new recruits was revamped and relaunched under the theme \u201cGolden 360\n0\u201d to focus on creating \na more interactive environment to increase engagement between the management and new entrants to the company. The buddy system for new recruits was also further strengthened to drive continuous engagement throughout the probationary period of new employees.

In addition to monetary incentives, we are also planning to formulate a special skill development program to enable best starters to integrate into the Company\u2019s talent pipeline in time.Developing talent for the future  \nOur talent development activities have traditionally delivered targeted training and capacity-building initiatives to support the developmental needs of our employees. Having invested in e-learning during the pandemic, we facilitate our operational trainings and soft skills trainings online.\nIn the current financial year, we further \nstrengthened our e-learning platform with the inclusion of new learning tools covering functional areas such as finance, IT, HR, marketing, etc. We have thus been able to create a platform to enable our employees to refresh critical skills on an ongoing basis.\nFollowing the expansion of the scope \nof e-learning activities, we initiated a special initiative to gauge the post-training performance of employees regularly with the findings being used to fine-tune our course content.CAPITAL REPORTS\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nBuilding the \nright team\nCreating the \nright culture\nDeveloping \nthe right skill\nFuture fit \nemployees + + =FUTURE FIT EMPLOYEES\nTRAINING INTERVENTIONS IN 2022/23\nCompetency development\nHolistic development initiatives to drive the \ninculcation of organisational competencies\nLeadership development\nTrainings for middle and senior managers \nacross sectors, with the aim of building the next generation leaders\nSector level training\nSector specific training programmes focused \non lean management, leadership development, technical skill building, marketing & sales among others\nManagement trainee programme\nThe Group inducted the new management \ntrainee batch with recruitment of 6 aspiring young professionals", "154": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23153Meanwhile, considering the labour migration \ntrend in the Country in 2022, more emphasis was given to building a pipeline of multi-talented employees who could potentially drive the strategic ambitions of the LBF Group in the years ahead.

As such, we have established specific parameters to determine salary scales for different employee categories. These include job role, level of responsibility, skills, competencies and work experience. We also monitor industry trends and labour market movements in our sector in order to make timely adjustments to ensure our remuneration and benefit structures remain competitive over time. \nThe determination of employee benefits \nis based primarily on the Shop and Office Employees Act of 1954, EPF Act, ETF Act, and the Payment of Gratuity Act of Sri Lanka. \nEmployee benefits 2019/20 \nRs.

The LBF Board and senior management provide leadership in setting the tone for high standards of business integrity. The Board-approved Code of Conduct outlines employees\u2019 duties towards colleagues and responsibilities as representatives of the Company, while the Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Policy sets out appropriate behaviours expected of employees in their interactions with customers and other external stakeholders. \nThe Board and the management also \ncollectively provide oversight to enforce the Code and the ABC Policy with the HR team tasked with raising employee awareness regarding these mandates and the repercussions of violation. The Code and the Policy are disseminated to new recruits during their orientation to help them understand and absorb LBF\u2019s ethics principles. All new recruits are further expected to sign a declaration indicating their understanding and acceptance of the Code of Conduct and the ABC Policy. Both the Code and Policy are also accessible through the e-learning platform for easy reference at any time.\nIn the year under review, a new Social Media \nConduct policy was implemented. An initiative by the newly convened HR and Remunerations Committee, the Social Media Policy sets out appropriate behavioural guidelines for use on both internal and public social media platforms.\nMeanwhile, as part of our integrated approach \nto promoting ethical business conduct at all levels of operation, we encourage employees and other stakeholders to raise concerns regarding conflicts of interest or any other perceived ethics violation. A whistleblower policy is also in place to enable reporting of fraud or financial irregularities or misappropriations, with the assurance of complete anonymity.\nGrievance handling \nWe encourage our teams to be open and forthright about discussing any work-related issues or grievances they may have. Various mechanisms including daily/weekly/monthly team briefings enable employees to express their opinions and voice their collective concerns to superiors, while our open-door policy allows employees to individually reach out to members of the senior management to address any issues that may be affecting their job role. Beyond this, the grievance procedure maintained by the HR department allows employees to formally escalate any concerns directly to the HR Head. Our Code of Conduct contains detailed information regarding LBF\u2019s grievance procedure, including when and how it should be activated and the standard timelines for when a resolution can be expected. No grievances were reported to the HR department in the year under review. \nHealth and safety \nProviding a safe and secure environment for employees to work in, is one of our top priorities. Accordingly, LBF complies with all mandatory fire safety measures at all company locations. Designated fire wardens have been appointed at every one of our locations, while the central administration department monitors fire safety systems, engages in regular maintenance of fire safety equipment, and oversees the annual fire drill process. These efforts are accompanied by regular safety training sessions covering all LBF employees. Since the pandemic, we have also been using the \u201cLife at LB\u201d facebook page to strengthen the safety awareness culture among our teams. \nAs a financial services business, LBF\u2019s day-to-\nday operations do not pose any occupational health and safety risks to employees. Hence the need for a dedicated safety system does not arise. However, our business continuity plan and crisis management plans include necessary measures to ensure employee safety in the event of an unforeseen crisis. \nEmployee engagement \nAfter a lapse of two years, we resumed physical employee engagement activities.  However, in light of the economic crisis in the country, no large gatherings were held throughout the year. All engagement activities were held on a smaller scale than in the past, mainly as branch / department-wise events.", "155": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23154Mechanisms to measure and monitor \nemployee satisfaction\nLBF participated in the \u201cGreat Place to Work\u201d \n(GPTW) survey in 2022. The survey which was conducted by an independent third party was rolled out as a company-wide initiative with all employees encouraged to participate.  \nWork stress  \nVarious initiatives continued to be implemented to help employees to manage work stress, especially in these economically challenging times. \u2018The SMILE\u2019 counselling hotline launched at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 and also remained active throughout the year to offer employees 24/7 assistance. \nHR governance \nHR governance is centralised under the purview of LBF\u2019s Human Resource Department (HRD). The HRD is led by the Head of HR who reports to LBF\u2019s Managing Director. The Head of HR also works closely with the Board Human Resource and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee, on certain HR-related matters. The HRD under the supervision of the Head of HR is responsible for ensuring LBF remains fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations on its employees. Beyond this, HRD is responsible for ensuring the Company\u2019s human capital development activities are carried out in line with the Board-approved policy frameworks.\n3\n CREATING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL \nAND INNOVATIVE CULTURE\n For the past five years, LBF has been blazing trails in the digital financial services space, thanks to comprehensive manpower planning and efforts to source top IT specialists and data scientists.  \nIn order to ensure we stay ahead of the game, \nwe are constantly on the lookout for talented IT professionals who can work independently and support business growth through effective ideation and innovation. Moving away from our traditional approaches, we held a special open day in February 2023 intending to attract IT professionals and data scientists.

This means, the key differentiator of our brand promise - our approach to Customer Relationships Management (CRM) which we like to call our customer experiences program, will need to evolve at a faster pace than the industry.

These include IT supplier security, IT operation processes (backup, restoration, etc.), IT/information security risk assessment process, IT assets management, IT capacity management process, information security incident management, etc. audit plans are submitted to the Board Audit Committee (BAC) for their recommendations and approval, before being operationalised.\nIn the current financial year, the IS audit \nteam took several additional measures to safeguard LBF\u2019s information security systems amidst ongoing challenges. The frequency of thematic audits was increased to verify if fundamental cyber security controls were being enacted according to established policies and procedures, especially by recruits. A series of special audits were carried out including web-based application security assessments, mobile app-based security assessments, and phishing simulations to ensure the Company has in place all appropriate control measures to mitigate new cyber risks/ attack vectors coming through the external cyberspace. An extra security layer was implemented to enable continuous assessment of the privilege activity monitoring function, while more frequent checks were done in connection to the user access management function. The IS team also began engaging more proactively with core IT teams to understand risk factors and control requirements of new technology adaptations/ new system developments in order to ensure all relevant risk factors are addressed prior to the live rollout of these initiatives.\nData privacy framework\nTo reinforce its commitment to data privacy, LBF strives to benchmark global best practices to create a secure environment for the protection of customer information. Our IT compliance and Information security team provides stewardship for all data protection matters as per LBF\u2019s Board approved data privacy policy. The team takes a 360\n0 approach to review and \nupdate all administrative, organisational, technical, and physical safeguards in order to strengthen the resilience of the Company\u2019s data protection environment on an ongoing basis. More recently we have also started leveraging the latest AI-based tools to flag possible internal threats.\nIn 2022, LBF began working towards early \nadoption of the mandates set out under the Personal Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022. As a first step, we introduced a cookie policy to LBF\u2019s newly updated corporate website. In parallel, an internal study was carried out to determine the scope of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) as relevant to our business. Based on our findings, we are currently working on establishing the parameters needed to implement a suitable framework for safely managing PII. We are currently in the process of evaluating appropriate solutions to support these efforts.\nInformation security governance\nInformation Security Governance plays a vital role in building our defenses against internal and external attacks that could compromise the integrity of our data assets. In this regard, LBF\u2019s Information Security Officer (ISO) is responsible for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering IT functions / Controls and reports, tracking and following up on remediation plans in compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements applicable to information technology, data, and information security.Main focus areas\n Network, Security & Infrastructure.\n Database.\n System Support.\n IT Operations.\n IT Help-Desk.\n Digital Channels.\n Software Development.\nDuties and responsibilities of the ISO\n Review and monitor privileged access activities.\n Coordinate internal and external IS audits.\n Coordinate the functions related to ISO 27001:2013 certification.\n Review and recommend to the BAC regarding amendments to IT-related policies and operational procedures based on the compliance requirements.\n Weekly/monthly/annual monitoring of information security and cyber risks. \n Follow up on corrective and preventive action plans of audit findings. \n Conduct information security awareness campaigns.\n Coordinate vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.\n Conduct due diligence assessments, and security reviews on vendors.

To date, we delivered the data infrastructure, data pipelines, models, and analytics that generate data insights based on user events and activities, and we have built an AI and machine-learning infrastructure to support both ongoing data-driven insights and real-time delivery of insights to customers, merchants, and tenants based on their behaviour on the platform, serving their needs at the moment with relevant recommendations and offers.\nAt the same time, we are looking to actively \nleverage social media\u2019s AI and big data capability to interact more frequently with our customers to deepen our understanding of their evolving needs and respond quickly and effectively.\nIn recent years, especially since the \npandemic, our quest for product and process innovation has been driven in equal parts by Robotic Process Automation  (RPA) and Data science. Today we leverage advanced analytics and AI-based machine learning tools  to drive internal cost efficiencies as well as to support our customer service excellence goals.\nCustomised research\nIn the past five years, LBF has come to seek out research-based insights to drive innovation and cost efficiencies across its operations. Since it was first established in 2020, our in-house data science team - the Center for Technology and Innovation (CTI)- has been leading the research front. \nIn the current financial year, the CTI entered \ninto two long-term partnerships with leading state universities in Sri Lanka. The first was with the University of Moratuwa (UoM) to gain access to UoM\u2019s academia in relation to the data science field and the second with the University of Colombo (UoC) was to collaborate with UoC\u2019s IT faculty to commercialise viable financial solutions.\nDue diligence\nAs a large financial services institution, we realise the importance of being proactive in carrying out due diligence to verify the efficacy of our internal systems and processes. LBF\u2019s Internal Audit Department (IAD) has been assigned as the main facilitator of due diligence activities and provides independent assurance to the board, audit committee, and management, regarding the efficacy of the Company\u2019s risk management, governance, and internal control processes in supporting corporate objectives. To that end, the IAD conducts four types of audits - process audits focused on evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of specific processes; gold loan audits to verify the accuracy and completeness of gold articles retained; branch audits to measure the risk profile of each branch against established risk metrics; cash audits that usually take the form of spot checks to compare cash collections against documented sources.\nIn this way, the IAD serves as the third line of \ndefense of the group by providing objective insights, evaluation of business risks and protection of assets, validation of business and/or process controls, cost and waste reduction opportunities, effective corporate governance, assurance on legal and other regulatory compliance. \nIn the current financial year, the IAD initiated \nseveral programs to strengthen due diligence in certain areas. With the rapid growth in our gold loan portfolio raising the risk of fraudulent articles being held as collateral, the IAD introduced a series of new exception monitoring guidelines along with special training to inculcate the \u201canti-fraud culture\u201d at the branch level.", "167": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23166Internal audit update for 2022/23\nFocus area No. of audits and key \nprocesses auditedImprovements made Impact to LBF\nBranch OperationsGold loan audit process - More than 700\nCash / surprise \nverifications - More than 850\nCredit and Lending - More \nthan 90\nFD and savings - More \nthan 90 Insisted on new policies/procedures or amending the existing to implement more compliance towards culture and create accountabilities for non-compliances\n Addressed internal control gaps in the process of the auditees in concurrence with respective process owners\n Implemented self-detection mechanisms to act efficiently in remediating non-compliances.\n Implemented exception monitoring mechanisms to duly act on abnormal transactions.

Given the high volume of calls received by our call centres about balance inquiries, a special hotline was created on whatsApp and published on all social media platforms and the corporate website. We also established a dedicated inbound hotline to manage inquiries coming through our social media platforms.  \nAs a follow, up to the fully automated \ncustomer relationship management system that was rolled out in 2021, the complaint handling process was further streamlined with call center agents empowered to provide on-the-spot solutions in coordination with relevant and operational teams.

This approach was consistent with our efforts to inform customers and the wider community to exercise greater financial discipline during challenging economic conditions.\nWe leveraged LBF\u2019s facebook page to \ncreate positive conversations revolving around solutions to ongoing challenges with all content made shareable to spread the message to a wider audience. \u2018LB Saara Siththam\u2019, a short movie series on \nSocial Media\nComplaints Management Unit\nGeneral Hotline\nMarketing Monitoring Unit\nComplains Hotline\nWebsite/e-mail\nWebsite/e-mailCALL CENTRE\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT MODEL\nLBF\u2019s  \ncustomer/\ngeneral  \npublicCall centre \nagentsResponsible \nofficers", "179": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23178CAPITAL REPORTS\nSOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL \nEXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\nIdentify the problem\nDatabaseIdentify the parties \nfor the issue\nIdentify the repeating problemSolving problemReduce the risk of dissatisfactionHEAD OF MARKETING\nDissatisfied \ncustomerSatisfied customer\nCall centre \nagents\nthe importance of human connections was \none of the key facebook campaigns run in the current financial year.

This includes considerations of social and environmental sustainability, ethical business practices, and adherence to legal and regulatory frameworks. The Board believes that operating with a strong conscience validates the company\u2019s financial success and helps to foster trust and build stakeholder confidence.\nEthical culture\nEthics comprise the principles, core values, and standards that govern the LBF\u2019s behaviour and decision-making. The Board sets the tone from the top for establishing an enterprise-wide culture of ethics to ensure all employees act with integrity and honesty in all their actions. This includes upholding legal and regulatory requirements, avoiding conflicts of interest, promoting diversity and inclusion, respecting human rights, protecting the environment, and ensuring transparency and accountability in all business activities.\nThe culture of ethics also encompasses \nopenness. The Board demonstrates its willingness to openness by sharing information and communicating openly with internal and external stakeholders. This commitment is articulated in various ways, such as open-door policies, regular communication and feedback channels, effective handling of grievances and a commitment to timely and accurate reporting. Openness also involves sharing information about organisational goals and objectives, financial performance, decision-making processes, and corporate social responsibility initiatives.Stewardship \nThe members of the Board are the stewards of LBF, exercising independent judgment in overseeing management and safeguarding the interests of shareholders. In fulfilling its stewardship role, the Board seeks to instil and foster a corporate environment founded on integrity and to provide Management with sound guidance in pursuit of long-term shareholder value \nStrategic oversight\nThe members of the Board are the key advisors to Management, advising on strategic direction, objectives and action plans, taking into account both the opportunities and LBF\u2019s risk appetite. In carrying out this oversight role, the Board actively engages in setting the long term strategic goals for the organisation, reviews and approves business strategies, corporate financial objectives and financial and capital plans that are consistent with the strategic goals, and monitors LBF\u2019s performance in executing strategies and meeting objectives. \nRisk oversight\nThe Board oversees the framework, policies and systems to identify and manage risks to the businesses and seeks to embed a strong risk management culture throughout LBF. The Board actively monitors the organisation\u2019s risk profile relative to risk appetite and seeks to ensure that Management\u2019s plans and activities provide an appropriate balance of return for the risks assumed and are prudently focused on generating shareholder value. \nIndependence\nIndependence from Management is fundamental to the Board\u2019s effective oversight and mechanisms are in place to ensure its independence. All direct and indirect material relationships with LBF are considered in determining whether a member of the Board is independent. Accountability\nAccountability involves being upfront in accepting and taking ownership of the consequences of Board actions and decisions, both positive and negative. The Board sets the tone for accountability through clear goals and objectives, establishing performance targets, regularly measuring and evaluating performance, and taking appropriate corrective action when necessary.\nFairness\nFairness revolves around the equitable treatment of all stakeholders. The Board emulates the principle of fairness through a strong and unequivocal commitment to impartiality and consistency in decision-making in fairness to all people and entities that the company has dealings with. \nProfessionalism\nProfessionalism involves a commitment to excellence and continuous improvement, as well as a dedication to the highest ethical and legal standards. The Board leads by example in demonstrating professionalism through its actions and conduct, such as maintaining a high level of knowledge and skill, adhering to professional codes of conduct and ethics, behaving with integrity and honesty, communicating effectively and respectfully, and treating colleagues, clients, and other stakeholders with respect and dignity. \nContinuous Improvement\nThe Board is committed to continuous improvement of its corporate governance principles, policies and practices, which are designed to align the interests of the Board and Management with those of shareholders, to support the stewardship role of the Board and to enhance the Board\u2019s ability to safeguard the interests of shareholders through independent supervision of Management.

The system of internal controls is primarily designed to manage the Company\u2019s key areas of risk within an acceptable risk profile, rather than to eliminate the risk of failing to achieve the policies and business objectives.  However, it is important to note that the system of internal controls stipulated can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement of financial information, records, or against financial losses and frauds.\nIn light of the above, the Board has \nestablished a continuous process of identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company. This includes enhancing the system of internal control over financial reporting, especially when there are changes to the business environment or regulatory guidelines. The Board regularly reviews this process by assessing key processes related risks against the compensating controls that may affect significant accounts of the Company.\nThe management is tasked with assisting the \nBoard in the implementation of the policies and procedures related to risk and control. This includes identifying and assessing the risks faced by the Company as well as providing inputs on design, operation and monitoring of internal controls over financial reporting to mitigate and control these risks.The Board is confident that the system of internal control over financial reporting is adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting.

The Board Audit Committee follows up the regular reviews of policies, charters, and procedures through the Compliance officer to ensure timely updates. \n\u00bb The Internal Audit Department of the Company monitors compliance with policies and procedures, and their suitability of design and effectiveness on an ongoing basis.  Statistical verification procedures are used, and significant findings of non-compliance are highlighted. The risk-based annual audit plan is reviewed and approved by the Board Audit Committee, branches and service departments are audited to provide independent and objective assurance on operations and performance. Various initiatives have been taken by Internal Audit Department, business teams and other monitoring authorities of the Company to review the exceptions on certain selected areas of the business through the usage of exception monitoring automated tools. The process has been gradually expanded year after year to cover an expanded scope.\n\u00bb Information systems and its surrounding technology infrastructure which support financial reporting are independently assessed by specialized information systems audit team to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability triads are preserved to reinforce the confidence level of the data processing technology facilities. \n\u00bb The scope, quality and reports of internal audits are reviewed by the Board Audit Committee at its monthly meetings and refinements are applied wherever necessary.\n\u00bb Overall, the Board Audit Committee of the Company reviews internal control issues identified by the Internal Audit Department, the External Auditor, regulatory authorities and the management, and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems. \n\u00bb A process has been set up to continuously monitor the internal control system over financial reporting to mitigate the risk on misrepresentation of financial reporting.

In addressing the adequacy of the provision for credit impairment on financial assets carried at amortized cost, our audit procedures included the following key procedures: \n\u00bb We assessed the alignment of the Group\u2019s provision for credit impairment \ncomputations and underlying methodology including responses to market economic volatility with its accounting policies, based on the best available information up to the date of our report.\n\u00bb We evaluated the Internal controls over estimation of credit impairment, which included assessing the level of oversight, review and approval of impairment allowances policies and procedures by the Board and management. \n\u00bb We checked the completeness, accuracy and classification of the underlying data used in the computation of impairment allowances by agreeing details to relevant source documents and accounting records of the Group.\n\u00bb We tested key inputs as disclosed in notes 4.17 & 4.18 and the calculations used in the provision for credit impairment.\n\u00bb We assessed whether judgments used in assumptions and estimates made by the management when estimating future cashflows, in the underlying methodology and management overlays were reasonable. Our assessment included portfolio segmentation, elevated risk industries, evaluating the reasonableness of forward-looking information, different economic scenarios and probability weighting assigned to each scenario.\n\u00bb We assessed the adequacy of the related financial statement disclosures as set out in notes, 4.17 and 4.18 of the financial statements. \nInformation Technology (IT) systems and internal controls over financial reporting  \nGroup\u2019s financial reporting process is significantly \nreliant on multiple IT systems with automated processes and internal controls. Further, key financial statement disclosures are prepared using data and reports generated by IT systems, that are compiled and formulated with the use of spreadsheets.\nAccordingly, IT systems and related internal \ncontrols over financial reporting were considered a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included the following.\n\u00bb We obtained an understanding of the Internal control environment of the \nprocesses and checked relevant controls relating to financial reporting and related disclosures.\n\u00bb We involved our internal specialized resources to check and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of IT systems and relevant controls , including those related to user access and change management. \n\u00bb We also obtained a high-level understanding, primarily through inquiry, of the cybersecurity risks affecting the group and the actions taken to address these risks.\n\u00bb We checked source data of the reports used to generate disclosures for accuracy and completeness, including review of general ledger reconciliations.\nOther information included in the \nGroup\u2019s 2023 Annual Report\nOther information consists of the \ninformation included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. Management is responsible for the other information.\nOur opinion on the financial statements \ndoes not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of management and \nthose charged with governance \nManagement is responsible for the \npreparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. ", "256": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23255In preparing the financial statements, \nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThose charged with governance are \nresponsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s and the Group\u2019s financial reporting process. \nAuditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of \nthe financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with \nSLAuSs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n1. identify and assess the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls of the Company and the Group. \n3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. \n4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. \n5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \n6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. \nWe also provide those charged with \ngovernance with a statement that we have complied with ethical requirements in accordance with the Code of Ethics regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \nFrom the matters communicated with those \ncharged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory \nRequirements\nAs required by section 163 (2) of the \nCompanies Act No. 07 of 2007, we have obtained all the information and explanations that were required for the audit and, as far as appears from our examination, proper accounting records have been kept by the Company.\nCA Sri Lanka membership number of the \nengagement partner responsible for signing this independent auditor\u2019s report is 2471.\n31 May 2023\nColombo\n", "257": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23256Financial Statements - Table of Contents\nNote \nNo.Page No.\nSection 01 - Primary  Financial Statements\nIncome Statement 257\nStatement of Comprehensive Income 258\nStatement of Financial Position 259\nStatement of Changes In Equity - Company 260\nStatement of Changes In Equity - Group 261\nStatement of Cash Flows 262\nSection 02 - Corporate Information\nReporting Entity 2.1 264\nConsolidated Financial Statements 2.2 264\nPrincipal Business Activities, Nature of Operations of \nthe Group and Ownership by the Company in Its Subsidiaries\n2.3 264\nApproval of Financial Statements by Directors 2.4 264\nStatement of Compliance 2.5 265\nResponsibilities for the Financial Statements 2.6 265\nApplication of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards 2.7 265\nBasis of Measurement 2.8 266\nGoing Concern 2.9 266\nFunctional and Presentation Currency 2.10 266\nPresentation of Financial Statements 2.11 266\nUse of Materiality, Aggregation,  \nOffsetting and Rounding 2.12 266\nComparative Information 2.13 266\nSri Lanka Accounting Standards Issued but not Yet \nEffective as at 31 March 2023 2.14 266\nChanges in Accounting Policies 2.15 267\nSignificant Accounting Assumptions, Judgments and \nEstimation Uncertainties 2.16 267\nSection 03 - General Accounting Policies and Notes\nBasis of Consolidation 3.1 268\nForeign Currency 3.2 268\nProvisions 3.3 268\nOperational Risk Events 3.4 269\nBorrowing Costs 3.5 269\nFinancial Guarantees and Loan Commitments 3.6 269\nImpairment of Non Financial Assets 3.7 269\nEstimating the Incremental Borrowing Rate 3.8 269\nSection 04 - Specific Accounting Policies and Notes\nNet Interest Income 4.1 270\nFee and Commission Income 4.2 272\nNet Trading Income 4.3 272\nOther Operating Income 4.4 273\nImpairment Charges 4.5 273\nPersonnel Expenses 4.6 277\nDepreciation and Amortisation 4.7 278\nOther Operating Expenses 4.8 279\nTax on Financial Services 4.9 279\nTaxation 4.10 280Note No.Page No.\nEarnings per Ordinary Share 4.11\n282\nDividend Paid and Proposed 4.12 282\nFinancial Instruments 4.13 283\nFair Value Measurement 4.14 286\nCash and Cash Equivalents 4.15 295\nFinancial Assets Recognised Through Profit or Loss - \nMeasured at Fair Value 4.16 296\nFinancial Assets at Amortised Cost - Loans and Receivables 4.17 297\nFinancial Assets at Amortised Cost - Lease Rentals \nReceivable and Stock out on Hire 4.18 300\nAllowance for Impairment Losses 4.19 304\nFinancial Assets Measured at Fair Value Through Other \nComprehensive Income 4.20 312\nOther Financial Assets 4.21 314\nOther Non Financial Assets 4.22 315\nInvestment in Subsidiaries 4.23 316\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Right-of-Use Assets 4.24 317\nInvestment Properties 4.25 323\nIntangible Assets 4.26 325\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 4.27 327\nDue to Banks 4.28 329\nFinancial Liabilities at Amortised Cost - Due to Depositors 4.29 330\nDebt Instruments Issued and Other Borrowed Funds 4.30 331\nOther Financial Liabilities 4.31 332\nOther Non Financial Liabilities 4.32 334\nCurrent Tax Liabilities 4.33 334\nPost Employment Benefit Liability 4.34 334\nStated Capital 4.35 337\nReserves 4.36 338\nRetained Earnings 4.37 339\nNon-Controlling Interest 4.38 339\nSection 05 - Risk Management Disclosures\nIntroduction 5.1 340\nCredit Risk 5.2 340\nLiquidity Risk and Funding Management 5.3 350\nMarket Risk 5.4 355\nCapital Adequacy 5.5 358\nProbable Impact of Economic Crisis on Business \nOperations of the Group 5.6 358\nSection 06 - Other Disclosures\nRelated Party Disclosures 6.1 359\nCapital 6.2 362\nCurrent and Non Current Analysis of Assets and Liabilities 6.3 363\nSegmental Information 6.4 364\nCommitments and Contingencies 6.5 365\nNet Asset Value Per Share 6.6 366\nAssets Pledged 6.7 366\nComparative Information 6.8 366\nEvents Occurring after the Reporting Date 6.9 367\nChanges in Liabilities Arising from Financing Activities 6.10 367", "258": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23257SECTION 01\nIncome Statement\nYear ended 31 March  Note Page \nNo.Company Group\n2023 2022 Change 2023 2022 Change\n Rs.

The presentation of these Financial Statements is also in compliance with the requirements of Finance Business Act No 42 of 2011, Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) guidelines.\nThese Financial Statements, except \nfor information on cash flows have been prepared following the accrual basis of accounting.\nThe Group did not adopt any \ninappropriate accounting treatments, which are not in compliance with the requirements of the SLFRSs and LKASs, regulations governing the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements.\n2.6 Responsibilities for the Financial \nStatements\nThe Board of Directors of the \nCompany is responsible for these Financial Statements of the Group and the Company as per the provisions of the Companies Act No 07 of 2007 and Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.\nThe Board of Directors \nacknowledges the responsibility in relation to the Financial Statements, as set out in the \u2018Directors\u2019 Responsibility for Financial Reporting, \u2018Annual Report of the Board of Directors\u2019 and in the statement appearing with the Statement of Financial Position of the Annual Report.2.7 Application of Sri Lanka \nAccounting Standards\n2.7.1 Amendments to LKAS 37 : Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\nIn 25 March 2021, the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to Sri Lanka Accounting Standard  \n- LKAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets) to specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making.\nThe amendments apply a \u201cdirectly \nrelated cost approach\u201d. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.\n2.7.2 Amendments to LKAS 16 : \nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use \nIn 25 March 2021, the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of  \nSri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued  Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use), which prohibits entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items in profit or loss.\n2.7.3 Amendments to SLFRS 03: \nBusiness Combinations - Updating a Reference to Conceptual Framework\nIn 23 March 2021, the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 03 (Business Combinations - Updating a Reference to the Conceptual Framework). The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the framework for the preparation and presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements.\nAn exception was also added to the \nrecognition principle of SLFRS 03 to avoid the issue of potential \u2018day 2\u2019 gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of  LKAS 37 or IFRIC 21 (Levies), if incurred separately.\nAt the same time, it was decided to \nclarify existing guidance in SLFRS 03 for contingent assets that would not be affected by replacing the reference to the framework for the preparation and presentation of Financial Statements.\n2.7.4  SLFRS 01 : First-time Adoption \nof Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards - Subsidiary as a  \nFirst-time Adopter \nAs part of its 2018-2020 annual \nimprovements to SLFRS standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 01 (First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards). The amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of SLFRS 01 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent, based on  the parent\u2019s date of transition to SLFRS. This amendment is also applied to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of SLFRS 01.\n2.7.5 SLFRS 09 : Financial Instruments - Fees in the \u201810 percent\u2019 T est for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\nAs part of its 2018-2020 annual \nimprovements to SLFRS standards process, the  Institute of Chartered", "267": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23266Notes to the Financial Statements\nAccountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri \nLanka) issued an amendment to Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 09 (Financial Instruments). The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other\u2019s behalf.     \n2.8 Basis of Measurement\nThe Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following material items in the Statement of Financial Position:\n\u2022  Financial assets recognised \nthrough profit or loss - measured at fair value\n\u2022  Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\u2022  Investment property measured at fair value\n\u2022  Liabilities for defined benefit obligations are recognised using an actuarial technique (projected unit credit method)\n2.9 Going Concern\nThe Management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Board has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions. The Directors assessed the future performance of the business and satisfied that it has the resources in place that are required to meet its ongoing regulatory requirements. The assessment is based upon business plans which contain future projections of profitability as well as projections of regulatory capital requirements and business funding needs. The business plan showed that the Group had sufficient capital in place to support its future business requirements and remained above its regulatory minimum requirements in the stress scenarios. Accordingly, the Directors concluded that there was a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a Going Concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. Furthermore, the Management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Financial Statements of the Group continue to be prepared on a Going Concern basis.\n2.10 Functional and Presentation \nCurrency\nThe Financial Statements of the \nCompany are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which LB Finance PLC operates.\nEach entity in the Group determines \nits own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of these entities are measured using that Functional Currency. These Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, the Group\u2019s Functional and Presentation Currency.\n2.11 Presentation of Financial \nStatements\nAssets and Liabilities of the Group \npresented in their Statements of Financial Position are grouped by nature and listed in an order that reflects their relative liquidity and maturity pattern. No adjustments have been made for inflationary factors affecting the Financial Statements. An analysis on recovery or settlement within 12 months after the reporting date (current) and more than 12 months after the reporting date (non\u2013current) is presented in Note 6.3 on \u2018Current and Non Current Analysis of Assets and Liabilities\u2019 to these Financial Statements.2.12 Use of Materiality, Aggregation, \nOffsetting and Rounding\n Materiality and Aggregation \nIn compliance with Sri Lanka \nAccounting Standard - LKAS 01 (Presentation of Financial Statements), each material class of similar items is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature or functions too are presented separately unless they are immaterial. \n Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial \nliabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset in the Income Statement unless required or permitted by an Accounting Standard.\n Rounding\nThe amounts in the Financial \nStatements have been rounded off to the nearest Rupees thousands, except where otherwise indicated as permitted by the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 01.\n2.13  Comparative Information\nComparative information including quantitative, narrative and descriptive information is disclosed in respect of the previous period in the Financial Statements in order to enhance the understanding of the current period\u2019s Financial Statements and to enhance the inter period comparability. The presentation and classification of the Financial Statements of the previous year are amended, where relevant for better presentation and to be comparable with those of the current year. \n2.14 Sri Lanka Accounting Standards \nIssued but Not yet Effective as at 31 March 2023\nThe new and amended standards \nand interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of Financial ", "268": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23267Statements are disclosed below. \nThe Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.\n2.14.1 Amendments to LKAS 08 : \nAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors - Definition of Accounting Estimates\nThe amendments clarify the \ndistinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amended standard clarifies that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors.\nThe amendments are effective for \nannual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The Group does not expect this will result in a material impact on its Financial Statements.\n2.14.2 Amendments to LKAS 12 : \nIncome Taxes - Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\nThe amendments clarify that where \npayments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability.\nAlso, under the amendments, the initial recognition exception does not apply to transactions that, on initial recognition, give a rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. It only applies if the recognition of a lease asset and lease liability (or decommissioning liability and decommissioning asset component) gives rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences that are not equal.\nThe amendments are effective for \nannual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The Group does not expect this will result in a material impact on its Financial Statements.\n2.14.3  Amendments to LKAS 01: \nPresentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Making Materiality Judgments \nAmendments to LKAS 01 and \nIFRS Practice Statement 2 (Making Materiality Judgments), provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgments to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by:  \n\u2022  Replacing the requirement \nfor entities to disclose their \u2018significant\u2019 accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their \u2018material\u2019 accounting policies.\n\u2022 Adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The Group is in the process of revisiting related financial statement disclosures to ensure the consistency with the amended requirements.\n2.15 Changes in Accounting Policies\nThe accounting policies adopted by the Group are consistent with those used in the previous financial year. Further, the Group has not early adopted any other accounting standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but not effective.2.16 Significant Accounting \nAssumptions, Judgments and Estimation Uncertainties \nThe preparation of Financial \nStatements of the Group in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards requires the management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. \nEstimates and underlying assumptions \nare reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.\nThe most significant areas of \nestimation uncertainties, critical judgments and assumptions in applying accounting policies that have most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements of the Group are as follows; \n3.7 Impairment of Non Financial \nAssets\n3.8 Estimating the Incremental Borrowing Rate\n4.10 Taxation\n4.13 Classification of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n4.14 Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n4.19 Allowance for Impairment Losses\n4.23 Investment in Subsidiaries\n4.24 Useful Lifetime of the Property, Plant and Equipment\n4.25 Fair Valuation of Investment Properties\n4.26 Useful Lifetime of the Intangible Assets\n4.27 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n4.34 Post Employment Benefit Liability\n6.5 Commitments and Contingencies\n6.9 Events Occurring after the Reporting Date", "269": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23268SECTION 03\nGeneral Accounting Policies and Notes\nAccounting policy relating to each accounting \ntopic is given along with the relevant note to the Financial Statements. The other significant accounting policies are described below;\n3.1 Basis of Consolidation\nThe Group\u2019s Financial Statements comprise, Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in terms of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements).\n3.1.1 Non-Controlling Interest\nDetails of Non-Controlling Interest are given in Note 4.38 to these Financial Statements.\n3.1.2 Investment in Subsidiaries\nDetails of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are set out in Note 4.23 to these Financial Statements.\n3.1.3 Loss of Control\nWhen the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related Non-Controlling Interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in Income Statement. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an Associate or in accordance with the Group\u2019s Accounting Policy for financial instruments depending on the level of influence retained.\n3.1.4 Transactions Eliminated on \nConsolidation\nIntra-group balances, transactions \nand any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group\u2019s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.3.2 Foreign Currency\n3.2.1 Foreign Currency Transactions and \nBalances\nForeign currency transactions are \ntranslated into the functional currency, which is Sri Lankan Rupees, using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. In this regard, the Company\u2019s practice is to use the middle rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.\nMonetary assets and liabilities \ndenominated in foreign currencies as at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the middle exchange rate of the functional currency ruling as at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency as at the beginning of the year adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate as at the reporting date.\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities \ndenominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the transaction.\nForeign currency differences arising on \ntranslation are generally recognised in Income Statement. However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of available for sale equity instruments are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n3.2.2 Foreign Currency Translations\nThe Group\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees, which is also the Company\u2019s functional currency. The Financial Statements of the foreign operations of the Company have been translated into the Group\u2019s presentation currency as explained under Note 3.2.3 below.3.2.3 Foreign Operations\nThe results and financial position of overseas operations that have a functional currency difference from the Company\u2019s presentation currency are translated into the Company\u2019s presentation currency as follows;\nAssets and liabilities, including \ngoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the rates of exchange rates ruling as at the reporting date.\nIncome and expenses are translated \nat the average exchange rate for the period, unless this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the rate prevailing at the transaction date, in which case income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction date.\nAll resulting exchange differences \nare recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve, which is a separate component of Equity, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to the Non-Controlling Interest.\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed \nof such that the control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount of the translation reserve is reattributed to Non-Controlling Interest.\n3.3 Provisions\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.Notes to the Financial Statements", "270": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23269The amount recognised is the best \nestimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation at that date. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is determined based on the present value of those cash flows. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured as the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.\nBefore a provision is established, the \nGroup recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the Income Statement net of any reimbursement.\n3.4 Operational Risk Events\nProvisions for operational risk events are recognised for losses incurred by the Group which do not relate directly to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation as at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and circumstances that affect the provision.\n3.5 Borrowing Costs\nAs per the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard \u2013 LKAS 23 (Borrowing Costs), the Group capitalises borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset. A qualifying asset is an asset which takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they occur.3.6 Financial Guarantees and Loan \nCommitments\nFinancial guarantees are contracts that \nrequire the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Loan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions. \nLoan commitments at below \nmarket interest rates drawdown are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of the ECL allowance and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised.\nThe nominal contractual value of \nfinancial guarantees, letters of credit and undrawn loan commitments, where the loan agreed to be provided is on market terms, are not recorded in the Statement of Financial Position.\nLoan types with undrawn limits are \nexpected to change the exposure over a period due to the available portion in the unutilised limit. The drawdowns for unutilised portions (only for Stage 01 and 02) are considered by applying the behavioural (average) use of the facility over the given period and current excess over the average (positive net exposure).Then the positive net exposure is classified as 12 month or lifetime expected credit loss.\nDetails of commitments and \ncontingencies are presented in  \nNote 6.5 to these Financial Statements.\n3.7 Impairment of Non Financial Assets\nThe Group assess at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or Cash Generating Unit\u2019s (CGU\u2019s) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre\u2013tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an \nassessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset\u2019s or CGU\u2019s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset\u2019s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceeds the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the Income Statement. A previously recognised impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n3.8 Estimating the Incremental \nBorrowing Rate\nFurther, as the Group cannot readily \ndetermine the interest rate implicit in the lease, it uses its Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) to measure the lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group \u2018would have to pay\u2019, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available (or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease).The Group estimates the IBR using observable input when available and is required to make certain entity-specific adjustments.", "271": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23270SECTION 04\nSpecific Accounting Policies and Notes\n4.1 Net Interest Income\n\u2002Accounting Policy\nRevenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be \nreliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised.\nThe Group use the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method for recognising the interest income and interest expenses of financial assets \nand financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income under SLFRS 09. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.   The calculation of EIR takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the EIR, but not future credit losses.\nThe carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts. \nThe adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original EIR and the change in carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge or reversal to the Income Statement.\nOnce the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest \nincome continues to be recognised, using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. Recognition of interest income is ceased when one or more of the criteria set out in Note 4.19 is present for a financial asset. More information on interest cessation is discussed in Note 4.19 to these Financial Statements. Interest from overdue rentals have been accounted for on a cash received basis.\n4.1.1 Income\nYear ended 31 March Company Group\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRs. '000 Rs. '000 Rs. '000 Rs.

This includes regular way trades, purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place. Loans and advances to customers are recognised on the date on which  it originated. The Group recognises balances due to depositors when funds are transferred to the Group.\n Classification and Initial Measurement of Financial Instruments\nThe classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model for \nmanaging the instruments. A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as per Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 09 (Financial Instruments). Trade receivables of subsidiaries are measured at the transaction price. When the fair value of financial instruments at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, the Group accounts for the Day 01 profit or loss.\n Day 01 Profit or Loss\nWhen the transaction price of the instrument differs from the fair value at origination and the fair value is based on a valuation \ntechnique using only inputs observable in market transactions, the Group recognises the difference between the transaction price and the fair value in net trading income. In those cases where fair value is based on models for which some of the inputs are not observable, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value is deferred and is only recognised in profit or loss when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.\n Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets\nAs per SLFRS 09, the Group classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets and the assets\u2019 \ncontractual terms measured at either; \n\u00bb Amortised Cost\n\u00bb Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)\n\u00bb Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\nThe subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.\n ", "285": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23284Notes to the Financial Statements\n Business Model Assessment\nGroup determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages the financial assets to achieve its objectives. The \nGroup\u2019s business model is not assessed on an instrument by instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as;\n\u00bb How the performance of the business model and the financial asset held within that business model are evaluated and reported to \nthe entity\u2019s key management personnel\n\u00bb The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed\n\u00bb How managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flow collected)\n\u00bb The expected frequency, value and timing of sales\nThe business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking \u2018worst case\u2019 or \u2018stress case\u2019 scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group\u2019s original expectation, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets.\n Contractual Cash Flow Characteristic Test (The SPPI Test)\nAs the second test of the classification process, the Group assesses the contractual terms of the financial asset to identify whether \nthose meet \u2018Solely the Payment of Principal and Interest\u2019 (SPPI) criteria.\nPrincipal for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition which may change over the \nlife of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount).\nThe most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money \nand credit risk. To make SPPI assessment, the Group applies judgment and considers relevant factors such as currency in which the financial asset is denominated and the period for which the interest rate is set.\n Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Liabilities\nAs per SLFRS 09, the Group classifies financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees and loan commitments into one of the \nfollowing categories;\n\u00bb Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and within this category as;\n\u2022 Held for trading; or\n\u2022 Designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\u00bb Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification.\n Reclassification of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesAs per SLFRS 09, Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except and only in those rare \ncircumstances when the Group changes its objective of the business model for managing such financial assets which may include the acquisition, disposal or termination of a business line.\nFinancial liabilities are not reclassified as such reclassifications are not permitted by SLFRS 09.\n Derecognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  \nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the \nrights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired.\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.\n Modification of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified, an assessment needs to be performed to determine whether the modified terms \nare substantially different from the existing terms. This assessment considers whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different. Where terms are substantially different, the existing financial asset will be derecognised and a new financial asset will be recognised at fair value. Where terms are not substantially different, then the modification does not result in derecognition of the financial asset.   Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.", "286": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/232854.13.1 Offsetting of Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only \nwhen, the Group has a legal right to set off the recognised amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nIncome and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under LKASs/SLFRSs, or for gains and losses arising from a \ngroup of similar transactions such as in the Group\u2019s trading activity.\nDuring the year Group has not offset any financial assets and financial liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position.\n Offsetting of Financial Instruments\nOffsetting of financial instruments based on the rights of set off relating to the financial instruments and cash collateral is as follows;\n Company\nAs at 31 March 2023 Gross  \nAmountsGross Amounts \nSet off on the \nStatement of \nFinancial PositionNet Amounts \nPresented on \nthe Statement of \nFinancial PositionCash  \nCollateral*Financial \nInstrument \nCollateral*Net  \nAmount\nRs.

The rights of set off relating to the \nfinancial instruments and cash collateral are conditional upon the default of the counterparty.\n4.14 Fair Value Measurement\n\u2002Accounting Policy\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n01. In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n02. In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or \nliability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non financial asset takes into account a market participant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses various valuation methodologies that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy assessment.\nLevel 1:   Inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates, currency    \n exchange rates and yield curves.\nLevel 3:  Inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions   \n market participants would use in pricing the instruments. \n Valuation Framework\nThe Company has an established control framework for the measurement of fair values. Finance Department is responsible for the \nvaluation of financial instruments. Obtaining input data, valuing of financial instruments and verifying the valuation models are being segregated within the finance department.\nWe review the inputs to the fair value measurements to ensure they are appropriately categorised within the fair value hierarchy. \nTransfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognised as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period.Notes to the Financial Statements", "288": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/232874.14.1 Fair Value Measurement Hierarchy - Financial and Non Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value\n4.14.1 (a) Financial and Non Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value - Company\nAs at  31 March  Note 2023 2022\nFair Value Measurement Using Total Fair \nValueFair Value Measurement Using Total Fair \nValueQuoted \nPrices in \nActive \nMarketsSignificant \nObservable \nInputsSignificant \nUnobservable \nInputsQuoted \nPrices in \nActive \nMarketsSignificant \nObservable \nInputsSignificant \nUnobservable \nInputs\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nRs.

Notes to the Financial Statements", "292": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23291 Valuation Methodologies and Assumptions\n Cash and Cash Equivalents\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which \nare subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal. A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Amounts on deposit and available upon demand, or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Time deposits and money market accounts that meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our Statement of Financial Position.\n Finance Receivables (Loans, Lease Rentals Receivable and Stock out on Hire)\nWe measure performing finance receivables at fair value for purposes of disclosure using internal valuation models. These models \nproject future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments (including principal and interest). The projected cash flows are discounted to present value based on assumptions regarding credit losses, prepayment speed, and applicable spreads to approximate current rates. Our assumptions regarding prepayment speed and credit losses are based on historical performance. We use the fair value of collateral to determine the fair value of non-performing finance receivables. The collateral for finance receivables is the vehicle financed, real estate, gold or other property. The fair value of finance receivables is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. Loans and advances granted to customers with a variable rate are considered to be carried at fair value in the books net of credit losses.\n Other Financial Assets\nSince all the balances which are under other financial assets have short-term maturities, it is assumed that the carrying amounts of \nthose balances approximate their fair values except for Investment in Treasury Bills.

These models project future cash flows of fixed deposits based on \nscheduled maturities (including principal and interest) and pre-maturities of deposits. The projected cash flows are discounted to present value based on applicable spreads to approximate current deposit rates for each tenor. Our assumptions regarding pre-maturity speed and spreads are based on historical performance. Savings deposits without a specific maturity are assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair values. The fair value of Due to Depositors is categorised within Level 3 of the hierarchy. \n Debentures, Bank Borrowings and Debt Instruments\nWe measure fair value for listed debentures using quoted prices for our own debentures with approximately the same remaining \nmaturities, where possible. If the particular debenture is off the run, we estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows and market-based expectations for interest rates, credit risk, and the contractual terms of the debenture. Comparable on the run debenture Yield to Maturity (YTM) assumed to be a good approximation for the fair value estimation of off the run debentures. We estimate the fair value of bank borrowings and debt instruments using discounted cash flows and use the most recent transacted rate and/or unexpired offered rate of a similar instrument or borrowing. Debt instrument and bank borrowing do not carry prepayment or embedded options. The fair value of debt is categorised within Level 2 of the hierarchy.\n Other Financial Liabilities\nSince all the liabilities which are under other financial liabilities have short-term maturities, it is assumed that the carrying amounts of \nthose liabilities approximate their fair values.

When the Group is the lessor under finance leases the amounts due under the leases, after deduction of unearned income, are recognised on the Statement of Financial Position. The finance income receivable is recognised in \u2018interest income\u2019 over the periods of the leases so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.\nLease and stock out on hire include financial assets measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met;\n\u00bb Assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.\n\u00bb Contractual terms of the assets give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the \nprincipal outstanding.\nAfter initial measurement, lease rentals receivable and stock out on hire are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR), less allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in \u2018interest income\u2019 in the Income Statement. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in \u2018impairment charges\u2019 in the Income Statement.Notes to the Financial Statements", "302": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23301 Company\nAs at 31 March 2023 2022\nLease  Hire  \n PurchaseTotal Lease  Hire  \n PurchaseTotal\nRs.

From 1 April 2018, the Group has been recording the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, in this section all referred to as \u2018financial instruments\u2019. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under SLFRS 09.\nThe ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset. The 12 months ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument \nthat are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.\nBoth Lifetime ECLs and 12 months ECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the nature of \nthe underlying portfolio of financial instruments.\nThe Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument\u2019s \ncredit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. Based on such process Group allocates loans into Stage 01, Stage 02, Stage 03 as described below;\n Stage 01\nWhen loans are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12 months ECLs. Stage 01 loans also include facilities \nwhere the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 02.\n Stage 02\nWhen a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records an allowance for the Lifetime ECLs. \nStage 02 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 03.\n Stage 03       \nWhen a loan is considered to be credit impaired/contain objective evidences of incurred loss, the Group records an allowance for the \nLifetime ECLs.\nDefinition of Default and Credit Impaired Assets\nThe Group considers loans and advances to customers be defaulted when the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligations to the Group \nin full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held) or the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.\n Significant Increase in Credit Risk\nThe Group continuously monitors all assets subject to ECL, in order to determine whether there has been a significant increase in \ncredit risk since initial recognition and whether the instrument or a portfolio of instruments is subject to 12 months ECL or Lifetime ECL. The Group considers an exposure to have a significant increase in credit risk at 30 days past due.\n Individually Significant Impairment Assessment and Loans which are Not Impaired Individually\nGroup will individually assess all significant customer exposures to identify whether there are any indicators of impairment. Loans \nwith objective evidence of incurred losses are classified as Stage 03. Loans which are individually significant but not impaired will be assessed collectively for impairment under either Stage 01 or Stage 02, based on the above specified criteria to identify whether there have been a significant credit deterioration since origination.Notes to the Financial Statements", "306": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23305While establishing significant credit deterioration, Group will consider the following criteria;\n\u00bb Other changes in the rates or terms of an existing financial instrument that would be significantly different if the instrument was \nnewly originated.\n\u00bb Significant changes in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument or similar financial instrument.\n\u00bb Other information related to the borrower, such as changes in the price of a borrower\u2019s debt/equity instrument.\n\u00bb An actual/expected internal credit rating downgrade for the borrower or decrease in behavioural score used to assess credit risk internally.\n\u00bb Existing or forecasted adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change in the borrower\u2019s ability to meet its obligation.\n\u00bb An actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the borrower in relation to actual/expected decline in revenue, increase in operating risk, working capital deficiency, decrease in asset quality, increase in gearing and liquidity management problems.\n\u00bb Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower. \n\u00bb An actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the borrower that results in a significant change in the borrower\u2019s ability to meet the debt obligation.\n Grouping Financial Assets Measured on a Collective Basis\nAs explained above, Group calculates ECL either on a collective or individual basis. Asset classes where Company calculates ECL on an \nindividual basis includes all individually significant assets which belong to Stage 03. All assets which belong to Stage 01 and 02 will be assessed collectively for impairment.\nThe Group allocates smaller homogeneous exposures based on a combination of internal and external characteristics such as product \ntype, customer type, days past due etc.\n Calculation of ECL\nThe expected cash shortfalls are calculated by multiplying respective loan level PDs, EADs and LGDs. The cash shortfall is discounted \nto the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.\nPDs and LGDs are adjusted to the forward looking information using statistically quantified variance.The mechanics of the ECL calculation are outlined below and the key elements are as follows;\n\u00bb Probability of Default (PD) : PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. Hence majority of our client \nbase being retail; we use internal information to estimate the PDs. The client has two credit statuses which can be identified as default or not default. We used Cohort Method (CM) to compute the PDs.\n\u00bb Exposure at Default (EAD) : EAD is the estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of the principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise and expected draw downs on committed facilities.\n\u00bb Loss Given Default (LGD) : LGD is an estimate of the loss arising, where a default occurs at a given time calculated based on historical recovery data. It is usually expressed as percentage of the EAD.\nFor all products, the Company considers maximum period over which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a financial instrument. \nThe published global financial sector credit rating migration matrix Probability of Default used for fixed income (bank deposits) \nsecurities expected loss calculation, Value at Risk Methodology (VAR) is used for gold based loan expected loss calculation. Any financial asset, fully secured through a cash collateral, has not taken into the expected loss calculation.\n Forward Looking Information\nCompany relies on broad range of qualitative/quantitative forward looking information as economic inputs in the Multiple economic \nfactor model developed to forecast the expected Non-Performing Loans (NPL).\nThe model predicts the forward industry NPL levels and which has been used to adjust the Company PD curve using statistically \nquantified variance. The economic factor model is developed by the University of Colombo, Science and Technology CELL and consent ", "307": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23306to use with an annual review. The economic factor model uses the machine learning technique to predict the NPL based on the use of \nsome key economic factors as an input to the model. The key variables of the model is as follows;\n\u00bb Industry NPL\n\u00bb Per Capita GDP\n\u00bb Business Confidence Index\n\u00bb Unemployment Rates\n\u00bb All Share Price Index (ASPI)\u00bb Balance of Payment\n\u00bb Exchange Rates\n\u00bb Budget Deficit as a Percentage of GDP\n\u00bb Fuel Prices\u00bb Rainfall\n\u00bb GDP Growth Rate\n\u00bb Interest Rates\n\u00bb Inflation Rates \n \n Reversals of Impairment\nIf the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event \noccurring after the impairment was recognised, the excess is written back by reducing the financial asset impairment allowance account accordingly. The write-back is recognised in the Income Statement.\n Write-off of Loans and Receivables\nFinancial assets and the related impairment allowance accounts are generally written-off when there is no realistic prospect of \nrecovery. Where financial assets are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security.\n Collateral Valuation\nRevaluation of immovable properties obtained as collaterals against any accommodation granted are assessed based on the \nrequirements in the Direction No 04 of 2018 on \u201cValuation of Immovable Properties\u201d and subsequent amendments thereto issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). The assessment of immovable properties is carrying out by independent professional valuers as required by the said direction issued by CBSL.\nThe assessed fair value of the immovable properties does not consider for the measurement of regulatory provisions for bad and \ndoubtful debts as per Direction No 01 of 2020 and subsequent amendments thereto issued by CBSL.\n Collateral Repossessed       \nRepossessed collateral will not be taken into books of accounts unless the Group has taken those collaterals into its business \noperations. However such additions from the repossessed collaterals to the business operations are not significant. \n Non-Accrual Receivables\nCessation of interest income recognition is triggered out when the receivables are more than 90 days past due in arrears, receivables \nare subject to legal action/ongoing legal action, receivables are subject to untraceable or unattainable collaterals, or receivables are determined to be uncollectible. For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognised only to the extent a payment is received. Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance.       \n     \n  \n     \n  \n     \n  \n     \n  Notes to the Financial Statements", "308": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/233074.19.1 Stage-wise Analysis of the Allowance for Impairment Losses - Company\n2023 2022\nStage 01 Stage 02 Stage 03 Total Stage 01 Stage 02 Stage 03 Total\nRs.

This becomes more complex, particularly in times of economic volatility and uncertainty. The Group form multiple economic scenarios based on economic forecasts to estimate future credit losses and to determine an unbiased ECL estimate. Management judgments are used to address the data and model limitations and expert credit judgments.\n Methodology\nThe Group have been used three scenarios at multiple confidence levels to capture the exceptional nature of the current economic \nenvironment and to simulate management\u2019s view of the range of potential outcomes. The range of forecasts are generated through the model due to the uncertainty caused by current adverse economic conditions. These three scenarios are drawn from the model developed by the Company with Colombo Science and Technology CELL of University of Colombo. The model uses multiple economic variables like GDP, unemployment, inflation, and trained to identify the historical correlations. The impact arising from the upside, downside and base scenarios have been simulated through a machine learning technique.  Economic forecasts are subject to a high degree of uncertainty in the current environment. Limitations of forecasts and economic models require a greater reliance on management judgement in addressing both the error inherent in economic forecasts and in assessing associated ECL outcomes.\n ECL Scenarios and Sensitivity Analysis of Allowance for Impairment Losses \nAs expected, the scenarios create differing impacts on ECL and the impacts are deemed reasonable. In this simulation, it is assumed \nthat existing modelled relationships between key economic variables and loss drivers hold, but in practice other factors would also have an impact, for example, potential customer behaviour changes and policy changes by lenders that might impact on the wider availability of credit.\nThe simulated ECL impacts of the multiple scenarios are presented in the table below;\n Economic Factor Adjustment - Percentage Variance \nUpto 01 Year Beyond 01 Year\nBase  Upside  Downside Base  Upside  Downside \nForecast -5.51% -27.80%\nAt 99% Confidence -66.27% 55.84% -99.08% 58.99%\nAt 95% Confidence -52.09% 41.25% -92.79% 37.98%\nAt 90% Confidence -44.77% 33.74% -82.61% 27.01%\nAt 80% Confidence -36.04% 25.06% -70.52% 15.28%\n Economic Factor Adjustment - Value Variance\nUpto 01 Year Beyond 01 Year\nBase  Upside  Downside Base  Upside  Downside \nRs. \u2018000 Rs. \u2018000 Rs. \u2018000 Rs. \u2018000 Rs. \u2018000 Rs. \u2018000\nForecast  (68,911)  (347,384)\nAt 99% Confidence  (828,053)  697,773  (1,238,112)  737,079 \nAt 95% Confidence  (650,945)  515,429  (1,159,492)  474,577 \nAt 90% Confidence  (559,443)  421,622  (1,032,237)  337,545 \nAt 80% Confidence  (450,322)  313,113  (881,261)  190,975 \n      Notes to the Financial Statements", "312": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23311 Scenario Analysis\n Base Scenario        \nEconomic Factor Adjustment (EFA) model of the Company features a decrease in non-performing advances in 2024 and 2025 \naccording to the Base Scenario in line with the improving macro economic conditions. This results in a positive impact of 5.51% and positive impact of 27.80% in the year 2024 and 2025, respectively.  Despite the sharp contraction in economic activities, the measures from Government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka including tightening the policy interest rates, debt restructuring and measures for funding markets are expected to support the economy and the financial system. Such support intends to ensure economic activities will improve in long term. In addition, the proposed changes to fiscal policies and government finances mark a significant step forward in strengthening the economy and will ease the pressure on budget deficit, interest rates and exchange rates. We expect proposed changes and developments to contribute positively on recovery prospects.\n Upside Scenario\nCompared with the Base Scenario, the Upside Scenario features a faster recovery in economic activities during the first two years and \nbeyond. These include the timely implementation of proposed changes which will strengthen the overall economy, speedy recovery of all the industries that were affected by the adverse macro economic conditions. The Upside Scenario expects a significant decrease in the EFA 66.27% and 99.08% respectively in the first two years at confidence level of 99% which declines when the confidence level move downwards.\n Downside Scenario \nIn the Downside Scenario, economic recovery is considerably weaker compared with the Base Scenario. GDP growth remains weak, \nunemployment rates stay highly elevated and asset and commodity prices fall before gradually recovering towards their long-run trends. This tend to impact the EFA negatively 55.84% in year 1 and 58.99% in year 2 and above at 99% confidence level. The slow recovery expects the EFA to be improve gradually over the next two years.\n Management Judgemental Adjustments\nManagement judgemental adjustments are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a customer or portfolio level \nto account for late-breaking events, model and data limitations and deficiencies, and expert credit judgement applied following management review and challenge.   Given the degree of uncertainty surrounding the adverse economic conditions and the lack of reliable data to model the impact on portfolio, as well as the operational and timing challenges in incorporating the latest available macroeconomic inputs into the ECL models, it was necessary to place greater emphasis on judgemental adjustments to modelled outcomes than in previous years. We have developed a consistent methodologies for the application of management judgemental adjustments into the calculation of ECL . These management judgemental adjustments made are described below.\nThe Company decided to use the down side scenario at 95% confidence level when assessing the economic factor adjustments with \nthe objective of capturing the impact of uncertainties in the future outlook on the ECL computation as at the reporting date. Further judgement was used to take an additional stress on the economic factor adjustment as a prudential measure due to the nature and the complexity of current economic conditions.\nThe governmental support programmes and customer payment reliefs have dislocated the correlation between economic conditions \nand defaults on which models are based. The Group recognised that the Management judgemental adjustments are required to ensure that an appropriate amount of ECL impairment is recognised. Although the granting of the customer reliefs as directed by governmental and CBSL support programmes do not necessarily indicate that the credit risk of those facilities have significantly increased nor credit impaired. However, the management judged that the PDs applicable for credit impaired facilities to be applied in calculating the ECL for these facilities that are in stage 01 and stage 02.\nMeasures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 has affected economic activities, which in turn, has resulted in lost revenue \nand disrupted supply chain in the last couple of years. Business condition has continued to deteriorate during the financial year amidst demand side constrains. This adversely affected business dealing in many industries, especially those that involve close inperson contact industries. Industries that have been severely affected do not automatically trigger in additional consideration of ECL through the model. The Group judged that the portfolios concentrated in tourism, transport and construction sectors require further judgement in the last financial year and continued those sectors for further judgement due to adverse economic conditions during the current financial year. Thus, credit impaired PDs were applied for the facilities where the credit risk has not significantly increased or credit impaired under the tourism, transport and construction sectors.", "313": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/233124.20 Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income  \n\u2002Accounting Policy\nUpon initial recognition, the Group occasionally elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at \nFVOCI when they meet the definition of Equity under Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation) and are not held for trading.

The Group \u2018controls\u2019 an investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. This includes circumstances in which protective rights held (e.g. those resulting from a lending relationship) become substantive and lead to the Group having power over an investee.\nThe cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration. The acquired identifiable assets, \nliabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the initial measurement the Company continues to recognise the investments in subsidiaries at cost. \nThe Financial Statements of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which control commences \nuntil the date when control ceases.\nThe Financial Statements of the Subsidiaries in the Group have a common financial year which ends on 31 March.

The Group applies the requirements of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) in accounting for these assets.\n\u2002Accounting Policy\n Basis of Recognition\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the \nGroup and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.\n Measurement\nAn item of property, plant and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is initially measured at its cost. Cost includes \nexpenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and cost incurred subsequently to add, replace part of, or service it. The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of computer equipment.\n Cost Model \nThe Group applies cost model to property, plant and equipment and records at cost of purchase or construction together with any incidental \nexpenses thereon less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met.\n Subsequent Cost\nThe subsequent cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item \nif it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within that part will flow to the Group and its cost can be reliably measured. The costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are charged to the Income Statement as incurred. Costs incurred in using or redeploying an item is not included under carrying amount of an item.\n Derecognition\nThe carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are \nexpected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is included in the Income Statement when the item is derecognised.\nWhen replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the remaining carrying amount \nof the replaced part is derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost of inspections is derecognised.", "319": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23318 Right-of-Use Assets\nRight-of-use assets are presented together with property, plant and equipment in the Statement of Financial Position. Right-of-use assets of \nthe Group include land and buildings under long term rental agreements for its use as offices and branches.\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the date of commencement of the lease, which is the present value of lease payments to be \nmade over the lease term. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of the right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred, and lease payments made at or before  the commencement date less any lease incentives received.  \n Right-of-use assets are amortised on the straight line basis over the lease term.\n Depreciation\nThe Group provides depreciation from the date the assets are available for use up to the date of disposal, at the following rates on a straight \nline basis over the periods appropriate to the estimated useful lives, based on the pattern in which the asset\u2019s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is derecognised. Depreciation does not cease when the assets become idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. Freehold land is not depreciated.\nThe estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment of the Company as at 31 March 2023 are as follows;\nAsset Category Period (Years) Depreciation % per \nAnnum\nFreehold Buildings and Edifices 50 2%\nFurniture and Fittings 4-6.67 15-25%\nEquipment 4-5 20-25%\nMotor Vehicles 5-8 12.50-20%\nComputer Hardware and Equipment 4-5 20-25%\nImprovement of Leasehold Asset 6.67 15%\nFixtures and Fittings 4-5 20-25%\nThe above rates are compatible with the rates used by all Group entities.\n Accounting Estimates\n Useful Lifetime of the Property, Plant and Equipment\nThe Group reviews the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment at each reporting date. \nJudgment of the management is exercised in the estimation of these values, rates, methods and hence they are subject to uncertainty.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the investment properties are stated at fair \nvalue, which reflect market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value and the rental income from the investment property is recognised under other operating income in the Income Statement in the year in which they arise.\nWhere Group companies occupy a significant portion of the investment property of a subsidiary, such investment properties are \ntreated as property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and accounted for as per Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - LKAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment).\n Derecognition\nInvestment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently \nwithdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in the Income Statement in the year of retirement or disposal.\n Subsequent Transfers to/from Investment Properties \nTransfers are made to investment properties when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by the end of owner \noccupation, commencement of an operating lease to another party or completion of construction or development.\nTransfers are made from investment properties when, and only when, there is a change in use, evidenced by commencement of owner \noccupation or commencement of development with a view to sale.\nFor a transfer from investment properties to owner occupied property or inventories, the deemed cost of property for subsequent \naccounting is its fair value at the date of change in use.

The Group\u2019s intangible assets include the value of acquired goodwill and computer software.\n \n\u2002Accounting Policy\n Basis of Recognition\nAn intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the \nentity and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably. An intangible asset is initially measured at cost. \nThe cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial \nrecognition, these assets are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n Subsequent Expenditure\nExpenditure incurred on intangible assets is capitalised only when it is probable that this expenditure will enable the asset to generate \nfuture economic benefits in excess of its originally assessed standard of performance and this expenditure can be measured and attributed to the asset reliably. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n Derecognition of Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount of an item of intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected \nfrom its use. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset is included in the Income Statement when the item is derecognised. \n Useful Economic Lives, Amortisation and Impairment of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets, except for goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis in the Income Statement from the date when the asset \nis available for use, over the best estimate of its useful economic life based on a pattern in which the asset\u2019s economic benefits are consumed by the Group. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. Only finite-lived intangible asset is computer software of the Group. Goodwill is the indefinite-lived intangible asset which is subject to annual impairment test. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The Group assumes that there is no residual value for its intangible assets.\n Computer Software\nCost of all computer software licensed for use by the Group, which are not integrally related to associated hardware, which can be \nclearly identified, reliably measured and it\u2019s probable that they will lead to future economic benefits, are included in the Statement of Financial Position under the category of intangible assets and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. \nUseful lifetime of computer software is as follows;\nIntangible Asset Category Period (Years) Depreciation % per Annum\nComputer Software 3-5 20-33.33%\n        ", "327": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23326 Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a subsidiary or an associate over the Group\u2019s interest in the net fair value \nof the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Carrying amount of goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost and subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment \nlosses.\n Impairment Testing on Goodwill \nThe Group tests the goodwill for impairment annually and assess for any indication of impairment to ensure that its carrying amount \ndoes not exceed the recoverable amount. If an impairment loss is identified, it is recognised immediately to the Income Statement. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\nThe impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other \nassets pro rata to the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.\nAs at 31 March Company Group\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRs.

Notes to the Financial Statements", "328": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/233274.26.3  Goodwill arising on Business Combination\nThe recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value \nusing a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Cash Generating Unit. For Value In Use (VIU) Calculations, Group has used cash flow projections for a period of five years based on financial budgets approved by management. The key assumptions used are given below;\nRange\nExpected Business Growth Rate 20%\nDiscount Rate \u2013 Risk Free Rate Adjusted for the Specific Risk Relating to the Industry 18%\nTerminal Growth Rate 10%\nPre-tax discount rates - Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each Cash Generating Unit, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and derived from its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected rate of return on investment by the Group\u2019s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowing the Group is obliged to service. Segment specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.\nTerminal growth rate \u2013 The forecasted terminal growth rate used does not exceed the longterm average growth rate of the industry \nand country in which the entities operate.\n4.27 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\u2002Accounting Policy\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses \n(if any), to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the unused tax credits and unused tax losses carried forward can be utilised.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable \nthat sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the \nliability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n Accounting Estimates\nDeferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available \nagainst which such tax losses can be utilised. Judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits, together with the future tax planning strategies.

The measurement of projected future benefits is dependent on the stipulated formula, salary assumptions, demographics of the Group covered by the plan, and other key measurement assumptions. The net periodic benefit costs associated with the Group defined benefit plans are determined using assumptions regarding the benefit obligations. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subjected to significant uncertainty. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of Sri Lanka Government Bonds with extrapolated \nmaturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Future salary increases are based on expected future inflation rates and expected future salary increase rate of the Group.\nProvision has been made for retirement gratuities from the beginning of service for all employees, in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting \nStandard LKAS 19 on \u2018Employee Benefit\u2019. However, under the Payment of Gratuity Act No 12 of 1983, the liability to an employee arises only on completion of five years of continued service.\n Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses\nThe Group recognises the total actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group obligation in respect of the plan in Other \nComprehensive Income during the period in which it occurs.   \n Expected Return on Assets\nExpected return on assets is zero as the plan is not pre-funded.\n Funding ArrangementsThe gratuity liability is not externally funded.Notes to the Financial Statements", "336": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/233354.34.1 Post Employment Benefit Liability \nCompany Group\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRs.

Proper management of these risks is essential for the Group\u2019s sustainability and is crucial to all of its activities. To achieve this, the risk management function aims to proactively identify potential risks, analyse them, and take preventive measures to manage the risks while maximising risk-adjusted returns within the Group\u2019s risk appetite.\nThe Group identifies the following \nkey financial risks in its business operations.\n\u00bb Credit Risk\n\u00bb Liquidity Risk\n\u00bb Market Risk\n Risk Management Framework\nThe Risk Management Framework \nof the Group has been optimised through the application and the embedment of the risk management process including risk identification, risk analysis, risk measurement, risk management decision and execution, risk monitoring and reporting.\nThe overall responsibility and \noversight of the Risk Management Framework of the Group is vested with the Board of Directors. The Board Integrated Risk Management Committee (BIRMC), a Sub Committee appointed by the Board, is responsible for developing and monitoring Group\u2019s risk management policies practiced.The following management committees, each with a defined responsibility, support the BIRMC by executing their respective risk management mandates.\n\u00bb Asset and Liability Committee\n\u00bb Credit Committee\n\u00bb IT Steering Committee\n\u00bb Sustainability Committee\n Risk Management Department \n(RMD)\nWhilst  the business units bear \nprimary responsibility for risk management, the Risk Management Department (RMD) acts as a second line of defence, providing independent oversight. The Head of Risk Management leads the RMD, reporting directly to the Managing Director and functionally reporting to the BIRMC. The RMD works in harmony with other control functions in the Group, such as Internal Audit, Compliance, and Finance, which may uncover risk management issues. Each of these control functions has a unique focus, and overlap is minimised to ensure that their approaches are complementary and lead to consistent, effective, and timely escalation of risks.\n5.2 Credit Risk \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a borrower or counterparty to a financial instrument, fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group\u2019s loans and advances to customers/other companies and investments in debt securities. Credit risk constitutes the Group\u2019s largest risk exposure category. This can be broadly categorised into three types; default, concentration and settlement risk.Default Risk is the risk of the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of customer or counterparty to meet its debt or contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group\u2019s loans and advances to customers.\nConcentration Risk is the credit \nexposure being concentrated as a result of excessive build-up of exposure to a single counterparty, industry, product, geographical location or insufficient diversification. \nSettlement Risk is the risk of loss \narising from trading/investment activities when there is a mutual undertaking to deliver on a progressive basis.\nGroup manages credit risk by \nfocusing on following steps;\nThe credit risk management \ninitiates at the beginning of the loan origination stage which includes the preliminary screening of the customer and credit appraisal of the particular facility. The objective of this process is to assess the borrower\u2019s ability to meet its obligations in an objective manner. The Group has clearly defined guidelines for credit approvals where the limits have been set taking into consideration the factors such as maximum counterparty exposures, loan to value ratio and forced sale value. The entire credit risk management of the Group is governed by the Credit Risk Management Policy and Framework. This process is further strengthened by the credit risk scoring model which assigns each individual facility a score based on the payment history, strength of the collaterals and guarantors.\nA comprehensive set of credit risk \nindicators are monitored monthly to review credit concentrations, status of loan recoveries and compliance with regulatory and prudent exposure limits. Notes to the Financial Statements", "342": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23341 Post Disbursement Review\nThe Credit Department conducts \ninitial monitoring and follow-up activities for loans. If a loan becomes overdue for a period that exceeds the tolerance period, responsibility for recovery and collections is transferred to the Recoveries Department. The Risk Management Department (RMD) regularly reviews asset quality performance. To address delinquencies, early and effective follow-ups and reminders are implemented. For critical exposures, swift recovery actions are taken.\n Management of Large Exposures \n Credit Committee\nThe Credit Committee consists of \nthe Managing Director, Deputy Managing Director, Executive Directors, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Risk Management. Sanctioning of large exposures are primarily handled by the Credit Committee.   Impairment Assessment\nThe methodology of the impairment \nassessment has been explained in the Note 4.19 to these Financial Statements.\n Collateral and Other Credit Enhancements\nThe Group uses collateral, where \npossible, to mitigate its risks on financial assets. The collateral comes in various forms such as cash, vehicles, gold, securities, letters of guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories and other non financial assets. The fair value of collateral is generally assessed at the inception based on the guidelines issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Central Bank of Myanmar.\nTo the extent possible, the Group \nuses active market data for valuing financial assets, held as collateral. Non financial collateral, such as real estate, is valued based on data provided by third parties such as independent valuers.\n  Impact Assessment of Stressed Economic Conditions\nThe Group\u2019s Enterprise Risk \nManagement Framework aims to proactively manage the impact of unfavourable economic and market conditions while achieving the Company\u2019s risk-return objectives. This has been demonstrated by the Group\u2019s ability to maintain a lower level of non-performing loans (NPLs) compared to the industry average (LFCs and SLCs). The Group has always acted with due diligence and taken prudent measures to ensure effective and efficient repayment behavior from credit customers, while also safeguarding the interests of stakeholders.\n5.2.1 Analysis Of Credit Risk Exposure\nThe fair value of collateral for finance receivables is calculated based on the number of contracts multiplied by the loss severity and the Probability of Default (PD) percentage or the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the Average Recovery Value (ARV) percentage to determine the fair value adjustment.\nThe following tables show the maximum exposure to credit risk by class of financial asset.

Group\u2019s market liquidity risk is low if assets can be liquidated without \nmoving the price too much.\nFunding liquidity risk means the Group\u2019s inability to finance assets continuously at an acceptable borrowing rate. Funding liquidity \nrisk generally arises when creditors either withdraw credit or change the terms on which it is granted in such a way they are no longer profitable. Funding liquidity risk would increase if the Group\u2019s credit quality is, or at least perceived to be, deteriorating, but also because financial conditions as a whole are deteriorating.\nThe Group\u2019s primary objective in liquidity risk management is to ensure adequate funding for its businesses throughout market cycles, \nincluding periods of financial stress. To achieve this objective the Group regularly monitors liquidity position and maintain an adequate buffer of liquid assets. Group also maintains access to diverse funding sources to meet unforeseen liquidity requirements. All statutory and prudent liquidity ratios are monitored against tolerance limits and stress testing is carried out regularly to assess the effectiveness of liquidity management.

Among them, interest rate risk has been identified as the most critical risk given Group\u2019s nature of business.\n5.4.1 Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is a key constitute of the market risk exposure of the Group due to adverse and unanticipated movements in future interest rate which arises from core business activities; disbursing of credit facilities, accepting deposits and issuing debt instruments.\nDue to the nature of operations of the Group, the impact of interest rate risk is mainly on the earnings of the Group rather than the market \nvalue of portfolios. \nExcessive movements in market interest rate could result in severe volatility to Group\u2019s net interest income and net interest margin. Group\u2019s \nexposure to interest rate risk is primarily associated with factors such as; \n\u00bb Reprising risk arising from a fixed rate borrowing portfolio, where reprising frequency is different to that of the lending portfolio. \n\u00bb Yield curve risk arising from unanticipated shifts of the market yield curve.\nInterest rate risk is managed principally through minimising interest rate sensitive asset liability gaps. In order to ensure interest rate margin \nand spreads are maintained, the Group conducts periodic reviews and reprices its assets accordingly.\n5.4.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCommodity price risk refers to the uncertainties of future market values and of the size of the future income, caused by the fluctuation in the prices of commodities. Given the significance of the Gold Loans business to Group\u2019s overall loan book, sharp fluctuations to the gold prices could have an adverse impact to earnings. Gold price fluctuations lead to market risk which is the primary source of credit risk associated with this product.\nGroup currently manages the credit and market risks arising from adverse movements in Gold prices by adopting the following strategies;\u00bb Shorter product life: Group, as a credit risk management strategy lends for shorter periods allowing it to initiate its recovery process faster.\n \u00bb Frequent revisions to Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio: Group practices a process of revising advance offered per gold sovereign to reflect market \nvalue fluctuations to maintain the desired loan to value ratio.\n5.4.3 Equity Price Risk\nEquity price risk is the risk that the fair value of equities decreases as a result of changes in the levels of equity indices and the value of individual stocks.\n5.4.4 Exchange Rate Risk\nExchange rate risk is the risk of loss as a result of unhedged exposure to volatility in the local (LKR) exchange rate with other major currencies. Exchange risk could materialise as an indirect risk too, affecting local gold prices resulting in exaggerated commodity risk.\nGroup is exposed to two types of risk caused by currency volatility.Transaction risk \u2013This risk arises whenever the Group has contractual cash flows (receivables and payables) whose values are subject to \nunanticipated changes in exchange rates due to a contract being denominated in a foreign currency. This type of exposure is short-term to medium-term in nature.\nTranslation risk \u2013 This exposure arises from the effect of currency fluctuations on the consolidated financial statements, particularly when it \nhas foreign subsidiaries. This type of exposure is medium-term to long-term.\n5.4.5 Interest Rate Sensitivity\nThe following table demonstrates the impact on net interest income to a reasonably possible change in interest rates based on the \nassumption that a rate sensitive asset surplus would be subjected to reinvestment risk whereas a rate sensitive asset deficit would be subjected to funding risk.\nImpact on Net Interest Income due to a parallel rate shock of 100 basis points (bps) on rate sensitive assets and liabilities is shown below;\n Net Interest Income (NII) Sensitivity by Interest Rate Change \nAs at 31 March 2023 2022\nImpact on NII (Rs. \u2018000) Parallel \nIncrease  \n100 bpsParallel \nDecrease  \n100 bpsParallel \nIncrease  \n100 bpsParallel \nDecrease  \n100 bps\nAnnual Impact  (+) 297,074  (-) 297,074  (+) 244,991  (-) 244,991 ", "357": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23356Notes to the Financial Statements\n5.4.6 Interest Rate Risk Exposure on Financial Assets and Liabilities\n5.4.6  (a) The table below analyses the Company\u2019s interest rate risk exposure on financial assets and liabilities.

It is available to absorb unforeseen losses which will assure the \nsustainability of the Group\u2019s operations so the Group can remain in business. The more capital the Group has relative to the risks it takes, the more confidence the stakeholders are that it will meet its obligations to them. Group\u2019s capital management process is steered with the aim of holding sufficient capital to support the Group\u2019s risk appetite whilst maintaining adequate capital to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Company has acquired the majority stake of the Multi Finance PLC in line with the Consolidation Master Plan of Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka on 16 March 2022.

Diminishing forex reserves, huge piles of debt, devaluation of currency together with shortage of crops led the inflation to reach double digit levels. This crisis got further worsened by the power cuts, scarcity of gas and fuel which almost crippled the economy affecting all the sectors. \nIncreasing inflationary pressures coupled with disturbed economic activities affected the buying power and the repayment capacity \nof the citizens as a whole. This initially exerted  pressure on Company\u2019s credit risk profile and the management closely monitored the developments to take prompt risk mitigating actions. As a result the Company promoted the digital channels for loan repayments which acted as an enabler to the customers in servicing their loan facilities without visiting branches amidst the fuel shortage prevailed in the country. \nFurther the increase of policy rates  and subsequent increase in treasury bills rates compelled the market rates to increase significantly. \nAs a result the interest rate risk is on the rise for all financial institutions of the country including LB Finance PLC. The impact of rising interest rate  were significantly affecting the cost of funds of the Group. However the Company\u2019s established franchise for Gold Loans product which is a short term product  was strategically used to drive down impact to the net interest income.\nMoreover the economic crisis of the country acted as a real world stressed scenario where it created  negative vibes on funding \nand liquidity. As a stable and strong NBFI, LB Finance PLC has always maintained its capital and liquidity buffers over and above the regulatory minimum levels. Hence the Group\u2019s ability to withstand the shocks, stood at a higher level which reassured the resilience of the Group.Notes to the Financial Statements", "360": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23359SECTION 06  \nOther Disclosures\n6.1 Related Party Disclosures \nThe Group carried out transactions with key management and their related concerns and other related entities in the ordinary course \nof its business on an arms length basis at commercial rates except that the key management have availed facilities under the loan schemes uniformly applicable to all the staff.\nThe Company\u2019s parent undertaking is Vallibel One PLC.

The progressive deterioration in the Country\u2019s economic conditions saw credit risk at elevated levels, while the sovereign rating downgrade manifested a situation of liquidity tightening. BIRMC CHAIRMAN\u2019S MESSAGE \nWith many of the trends we saw during \nthe pandemic further amplified by the economic crisis, we proceeded to perform a critical assessment of our foundational risk capabilities and determine the efficacy of enterprise-wide risk governance processes. Key control framework of credit and liquidity risk, including appetite limits and tolerance thresholds were tightened and combined with more frequent monitoring and reporting to the BIRMC and the Board. \nFrom a capital adequacy perspective, with \nthe ICAAP process initiated in the previous financial year now well integrated into our capital management approach, a new working Group was appointed to conduct routine ICAAP assessment and support proactive reporting to the BIRMC and the Board.\nGiven the highly fluid environment in \nwhich we were required to operate in FY 2022/23, operational risk management, specifically fraud risk management became a key focus area. The introduction of the Technology Risk Management Policy and the Exception Reporting Policy was another key milestone which further strengthened the control environment of the Company.All in all, in a tremendously challenging year, I am pleased to report that LBF\u2019s key risks continued to be well managed and within the Board approved prudential limit frameworks.\nAshane Jayasekara\nChairman - Integrated Risk Management Committee\nLBF\u2019S RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH\nLBF risk management approach is based on ensuring consistent and effective management of risk through appropriate accountability and oversight.

Our approach to risk identification combines both top-down risk assessment by our leadership to determine how changes in the risk universe can stymie LBF\u2019s strategic direction, along with a bottom up approach wherein operational teams (1st line of defence) identify risk points that affect the day-to-day business.\nBoth the top-down and bottom-up \napproaches have also proven invaluable in identifying new emerging frontier risks that have the potential to affect our business over time.\nRisk Analysis and Measurement\nOur risk analysis process typically involves quantification of risks under normal and stressed conditions. Apart from this, various other quantitative and qualitative assessment metrics are also used to gauge the impact of specific risks. Risks are then plotted on a Risk Heat Map to measure the likelihood of occurrence against their impact with each risk category assigned a risk score. \nThe responsibility for risk analysis and \nmeasurement rests primarily with LBF\u2019s Risk Management Department (RMD).

Depending on the risk score, appropriate treatment methodologies may focus on either accepting, transferring, mitigating or avoiding risk. LBF\u2019s Risk Management Department under the guidance and oversight of the Board Integrated Risk Management Committee (BIRMC) are tasked with developing appropriate risk treatment approaches. \nRisk integration involves creating the \nnecessary risk architecture to embed the relevant risk treatment measures at a functional level. Board-approved Risk Appetite limits and internal control systems provide the foundation for LBF\u2019s risk architecture. Risk appetite limits for all key risk categories are accompanied with tolerance thresholds and key risk indicators (KRI\u2019s), together with internal control systems including risk-specific policies and procedures create the ecosystem for enterprise-wide risk integration. \nThe LBF Board, as the highest governing \nauthority in charge of risk management, is responsible for creating the risk architecture Risk Heat Map\nKey Risk Category Specific risk Risk likelihood Risk impact\nCredit risk Default/settlement risk\nConcentration risk\nLiquidity risk\nMarket risk Interest rate risk\nCommodity price risk\nExchange rate risk\nOperational risk\nInformation technology and information security risk\nHuman resources risk\nStrategic risk\nReputation risk\nLegal risk\nRisk indicator  \u2002High  \u2002Moderate  \u2002Low\nto support the desired level of risk integration, while the Risk Management department provides oversight for the implementation of these covenants. \nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\nRisk tolerance thresholds and KRI\u2019s are continuously monitored and recorded in the Risk Register. The Risk Register is a comprehensive document that captures the progress of ongoing risk identification, evaluation and mitigation approaches.

The ALCO\u2019s responsibilities include monitoring and managing the assets and liabilities of the Company and also maintaining the Company\u2019s overall liquidity position to ensure LBF\u2019s liquidity levels are in line with regulatory requirements. Market risk management also comes under the purview of the ALCO. In this regard, the ALCO is responsible for monitoring market risk, reporting and analysing, making proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans relating to market risk management.\nThe Credit Committee is held accountable \nfor the day-to-day management of credit risk. As part of their duties, the Credit Committee monitors LBF\u2019s lending portfolio and oversees the management of asset quality and recovery actions. The Committee also periodically reviews the credit policy and lending guidelines issued to business segments, vis-a-vis changing market conditions and industry dynamics.\nIT Steering Committee (ITSC) is charged with \nmanaging operational risk and more specifically IT risk. In doing so, the ITSC provides leadership for the planning and management of IT investment and the execution of LBF\u2019s IT strategy to support the achievement of the Company\u2019s growth objectives. The ITSC is further responsible for safeguarding the Company\u2019s information security infrastructure.\nThe Sustainability Committee is tasked with \nsafeguarding the Company against reputational risks that could arise as a result of sustainability issues. Accordingly, the Sustainability Committee is responsible for the formulation and the review of LBF\u2019s CSR policy and to ensure that CSR and sustainability initiatives undertaken by the Company have the capacity to augment LBF\u2019s reputation as a sustainable entity.

The Board sets the tone from the top to promote risk awareness via the risk architecture and control framework. In addition, the RMD conducts regular training and other capacity building initiatives to strengthen the risk awareness culture at all levels of the business.\nMANAGING KEY RISKS\nCREDIT RISK\nCredit Risk remained at elevated levels \nthroughout the current financial year, mainly as a consequence of the severe economic crisis that erupted in April 2022 and continued throughout much of the year. Amidst this backdrop, LBF\u2019s credit risk appetite limits were reviewed by the Board and further tightened at the onset of the crisis. These efforts were further supported by stricter tolerance limits on geographical locations, product wise limits and limits for high risk industries such as tourism, transport and construction which were among the worst affected by the economic crisis. Stemming from this, internal LTV\u2019s were revisited as part of a focused approach to limit the exposure to these risk elevated industries as well as to curtail large credit facilities. While moving ahead with plans to grow the Gold Loan portfolio, here too LBF adopted a highly selective lending approach based on the customer credit scoring mechanism.\nCredit Risk Management framework\nThe Credit Risk Management Framework is a fully fledged operational mechanism for the management of Credit Risk relating to lending activities in the day-to-day business. LBF\u2019s Credit Committee provides oversight for the proper implementation of the Credit Management Framework.\nCredit and Operations Manual\nThe main purpose of the Credit and Operations Manual is to safeguard the quality of the credit granted by LBF. It sets out specific guidelines for Credit Officers outlining granting criteria under each product category along with the framework of due diligence protocols to be followed at various levels in the loan origination process. \nCredit Approval Manual\nThe purpose of the Credit Approval Manual is to promote greater accountability within the credit decision making hierarchy. It specifies credit thresholds under each product category and details the structural controls including authority limits for credit approvals.\nRecovery Manual\nThe purpose of the Recovery Manual is to ensure post-disbursement credit risk mitigation activities are carried out effectively. The Recovery Manual sets out the procedures to be adopted by Recovery Officers starting from initial follow-up to the repossession of assets. It also contains the responsibilities of Recovery Officers relating to the documentation process to be followed at each stage of the recovery process.\nLoan Review Procedure \nLoan Review Procedure (LRP) of the Company explains the mechanism the Marketing Officers/ Recovery Officers shall follow after a facility has been disbursed. This contains the procedure that need to be practiced for the loans that are in arrears based on specific cut-off points. \nEarly Warning Mechanism \nThe Company\u2019s main criteria for early warning mechanism in identifying problem loans shall be based on the aging (arrears position) of the facilities. The LRP includes the process the Recovery Officers shall follow in developing the watch lists and the frequency of meetings that need to be hold in implementing follow-up actions for problem loans. \nDefault Risk\nThe potential financial loss to the Company if borrowers do not honour their repayment obligations to the Company as and when they fall \ndue.\nHow does the risk translate to the business:\nBorrowers\u2019 failure to meet their debt commitments towards the \nCompany, diminishes LBF\u2019s earning capacity in turn causing margin pressure due to increase in loan loss provisioning.

To achieve this objective the Company regularly monitors liquidity position and maintains an adequate buffer of liquid assets. The Company also maintains access to diverse funding sources to meet unforeseen liquidity requirements. All statutory and prudent liquidity ratios are monitored against tolerance limits and stress testing is carried out regularly to assess the effectiveness of liquidity management.\nLiquidity risk for a financial institution can take two forms; market liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk.  \n Market liquidity risk is the inability to exit a position easily or asset ill liquidity.\n Funding liquidity risk means the Company\u2019s inability to finance assets continuously at an acceptable borrowing rate. \nHow does the risk translate to the business:\nTypically, a Company\u2019s market liquidity risk is considered to be low if its assets can be \nliquidated without a significant shift in price.\nFunding liquidity risk generally arises when creditors either withdraw credit or change \nthe terms on which funds are granted in such a way they are no longer profitable. Funding liquidity risk would increase if the Company\u2019s credit quality is perceived to be deteriorating and also when the financial conditions as a whole are deteriorating.Key Risk Indicators:\n Net Liquidity Gap Based on Contractual Maturities \n Net Loans to Total Assets ratio\n Loans to Deposit Ratio \n Deposit Renewal Ratio\n Statutory Liquid Asset Ratio\n Funding Mix\n Interest Bearing Liabilities Mix\nLiquidity Risk Management Approach\nLBF\u2019s Liquidity management approach aims to build a solid funding base that will provide \na consistent source of funds to ensure that sufficient liquidity is maintained to support the Company\u2019s growth strategy, business plans and honour its financial obligations, under normal as well as adverse circumstances. Therefore, the Company aims to maintain an adequate buffer of liquid assets at all times. As part of its overall liquidity management strategy, LBF strives to maintain access to diverse funding sources both locally and internationally.  All statutory and prudent liquidity ratios are also monitored against tolerance limits while stress testing is carried out regularly to assess the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s liquidity management strategy.\nManaged by LBF\u2019s Treasury, the Group liquidity management strategy aims to ensure \nadequate capital and liquidity buffers are in place to comply with  the regulatory minimum requirements under normal and stressed conditions. \nIn this regard, LBF\u2019s main source of funding comes from deposit mobilisation activities. \nTo supplement the funds moblised through savings and deposits, the Group Treasury also pursues diverse funding sources both locally and internationally. \nLBF\u2019s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) provides oversight for the proper \nimplementation of the Liquidity StrategyMonitoring and Governance \n The ALCO is responsible for monitoring liquidity risk, reporting and analysing, making proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans relating to liquidity risk management. The Treasury Department prepares forecasted cash flow statement and presents at the ALCO to evaluate the future funding requirements of the Company.\n The Risk Management Department uses stressed behaviour modelling techniques to determine the Company\u2019s cash flow requirements, if any signs of stress are seen.\n Daily funding requirements are closely monitored by the Treasury Department taking into consideration routine cash flows as well as one-off outflows that relate to large single obligations.\nLiquidity Risk Management update - FY 2022/23\nTight market liquidity conditions in the April - June 2022 quarter saw the Country\u2019s financial sector as whole coming under pressure \nduring this period. With LBF too affected by these challenges, the Treasury undertook more frequent cash flow projections to safeguard the Company\u2019s liquidity position during these stress periods, while continuing to work with Banks to secure contingency funding facilities. Also with rising interest rates causing LBF\u2019s funding base to skew towards term deposits, the Treasury took steps to minimise the asset and liability mismatch in order to avoid undue stress on the Company\u2019s balance sheet.

A formal Board approved ICAAP policy was established to serve as the basis for the application of the ICAAP process. The Policy mandates that the ICAAP process be integrated into LBF\u2019s enterprise-wide risk management programme to consider the impact on the Company\u2019s capital adequacy ratios due to changes in risk profiles of all major risk categories - Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Credit Concentration Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Reputation Risk, Strategic Risk, Liquidity Risk, IT Risk, Information Security Risk, and Compliance Risk. Stress testing and scenario-based analysis under the ICAAP process takes into account potential risk of capital being inadequate under stressed conditions, thereby ensuring the Company\u2019s strategic plan and risk management plans can be aligned with the capital plan in a meaningful manner with inputs from Senior Management, Management Committees, Board Committees and the Board.

Given the nature of its operations, LBF remains most sensitive to  interest rate risk and commodity price risk, in particular gold prices which stems from the exposure to Gold Loans.\nInterest Rate Risk \nThe potential loss LBF would have to bear owing to unexpected movements in interest rates. The Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk is primarily associated with factors such as;\n Re-pricing risk arising from a fixed rate borrowing portfolio where re-pricing frequency is different to that of the lending portfolio.\n Yield curve risk arising from unanticipated shifts of the market yield curve.\nHow does the risk translate to the business:\nInterest rate volatility has a direct impact on LBF\u2019s Net Interest \nIncome (NII) and ultimately Net Interest Margins (NIMs). The fluctuations in market interest rates will result in either weakening or strengthening of NIMs depending on the rate structure (fixed/variable) of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities.Key Risk Indicators:\n Rate structure of interest bearing borrowings \n Stress tests on NIIINTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT REPORT", "384": "LB Finance PLC  Annual Report 2022/23383Interest Rate Risk Management Approach\nLBF\u2019s approach to Interest Rate Risk Management seeks to improve \nthe alignment between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and in doing so ensure that the margin spreads are not unduly affected by adverse movements in interest rates.

Accordingly, both lending and \nborrowing were driven by a short term focus. As per the recommendations of the ALCO, steps were taken to realign interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Consequently, the Gold Loan portfolio was strategically re-priced in tandem with interest rate movements in order minimise the adverse impact on margin spreads. As part of the broader approach to reduce rate sensitivity gaps, it was decided to shed large high cost deposits and instead mobilise more smaller ticket deposits.

How does a physician \ndo that ? The answer is b y taking proper medical documentation .\nWhat is medical documentation?\nDefinition: Medical documentation is an instrument which helps the health care staff to \nrecord all informat ion about patients\u2019 health status and the procedures provided by the \nhospital staff.\nIt is structured in a way to show that thehospital staff areaware of what they are doing ,and \nobserving the care they give to the patient . This iscarried outby taking down all important \ninformation from the patients\u2019 health status and history ,but also more detailed information\nincluding lab -values, X -rays, etc. (1).\nBy doing this it will be helpful in the future in case something would go wrong, because the \ndocumentat ionis considered an invaluable factor in the legal system. Hospital staff failing to \ndocument important information about the patient ,and hence increasing the risk management, \ncan be considered a serious breach and digression from the general healthcare standards (2, 3, \n4, 5).\nComplete medical records are the most important asset of a good health care system ( 6).\n\u201cThroughout a medical malpractice case, the most important piece of evidenc e will be the \nmedical record.\u201d( 6).", "2": "3If a physician does not have a complete medical documentatio n of a patient ,it will increase\ntheir chances of getting sued in the future. This isbecause they will not have the medical \nrecord written down to prove their side of the story.\nMedical documentation\nEvery physician should follow the rule \u201cif it isn\u2019t written down, you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d(6), and \nevery medical document should provide enough information so when a new physician \nreviews the medical record, they would know exactly what the patient was being seen for, \nincluding treat ment a nd future plan of action (6). \n\u201cThe purpose of collecting and storing patient information is to make it available for decision -\nmaking at a point of care or for analysis and act ion for management and policy\u201d (7).\nIt is important to understand that most pati ents may have more than on epoint of care, and that \nthey might move from one location to another, therefore it is important for their information \nto be made available at all points of care (7).\nThere are some required standards in order to represent infor mation for communication (i.e. \ndistributed health data networks) ( 7).\nAccording to the medical society of the District of Columbia, a patient\u2019s medical record \nshould be complete and legible ( 8).\nThere are some points the physician must adhere to (8):\nDocum entation:\n\uf0b7The date the patient was seen or admitted to the hospital .\n\uf0b7The reason for why the patient has come for a consultation .\n\uf0b7Appropriate history and examination for the patients\u2019 main presenting complaints . ", "3": "4\uf0b7Evaluation and treatment plan during a patients stay, and until after the patient has \nbeen discharged.  \nThe physician should be able to access the patients past and present diagnoses. The reason \nand result for diagnoses including X-rays, lab tests andother useful information should be \nincluded in themedical report. Health risk factors and everything about patients\u2019 progress \nshould be documented (including treatment), and everything added to the data must be dated \nand authenticated ( 8).\nThroughout the course of a medica l lawsuit,the most import ant evidence the health care \nphysician will have at their d isposal is the patient\u2019s medical record ( 6).\nIn many cases poor maintenance of medical records in addition to inadequate documentation \nwithin the patient\u2019s medical record scontribute to many losses . \nBy ensuring your records are precise ,legible and properly organized, your chances of \ndefending yourself in a law suit will be greatly increased (6).\nThe loss of many cases can be directly attributed to poorly maintained medical records ,or \nlack of docu mentation in the patient\u2019s medica lhistory . If your records are accurate, legible, \nand well organized, they will greatly increase your chances of successfully defending a \nlawsuit ( 6).\nGold standard:\nThere are a number of different ways to record patient history. Amongst the most common \nones are Electronic Health Recorder (HER) and paper based system (9).\nThe paper based system used to be the gold standard for keeping medical records, but today \nmany countries are replacing this method to a newer one. It is known as theelectronic health ", "4": "5care recorder . These changes are being implemented due to the inefficiency of paper based \nsystems (10).\nThe challenges of using paper based systems include :\n\uf0b7It is eas ier to misplace or lose information in paper charts ,and the outcome of this can \nbe very dangerous, \u201cone in seven hospitalizations aredue to missing clinical \ninformation \u201d(10).\n\uf0b7Health care workers are expected to know and remember many guidelines without any \nhelp \u2013\u201cA 2003 study in theNew England Journal of Medici ne reported that the \npatients receive only 55% of recommended preventive care service s.\u201d(10).\n\uf0b7It takes more time and more work to identify patients with individual characteristics \n(i.e. patients with diabetes or other diseases who need the same treatment or to know \nhow many patient need to be vaccinated by the same vaccine ) (10).\nThe modern Electronic Health Record is a way to view a patient\u2019s medical record sthrough a \ncomputerized interface (9),computer systems are used instead of paper charts, all compo nents \nof a clinical practice are fed into Electronic Health Recorders -everything from assessing a \npatient\u2019s history and main complaints to creating anew treatment plan for the patient. In \naddition to this, it is used for managing other areas in a clinic al practice as well like billing, \nsurgery, and organization of the hospital ( 10).\nThe aim of this new method is to improve and simplify the quality of patient care for the \nhealth care staff and for the patient (10).\nThe benefits with Electronic health recor dersare (9):\n\uf0b7There is b etter collection and storage of data , papers don\u2019t get accumulated.\n\uf0b7There are less medical errors, which can easily be done by bad handwriting .\n\uf0b7There is a h igher quality of hospital care .", "5": "6\uf0b7The patient can access some of their own da ta.\n\uf0b7Itis lesstime consuming compared to paper based systems .\n\uf0b7There is easier access to patient records ,andthe patient information can be accessed \nfrom outside of the hospital, this method can be very useful in emergencies ( 10).\n\uf0b7Medical pract ices can send messages , assign tasks or receive information \nelectronically from other hospitals ( 10).\nThe disadvantages of electronic health recorders are (9): \n\uf0b7There may be some data errors which can be time consuming .\n\uf0b7The quality of patient-doctor interaction may be decreased .\n\uf0b7To read text from a computer screen takes 40% more time than to read it in a printed\nform , and it might be more difficult for some medical staff that are not used to work \nwith computerized devices (11).\nPaper-based and electr onic patient rec ords are often used together to support different tasks .\nEven though the quality of the Electronic Health Recorder is better ,most physicians still \nregard the pape r record as the gold standard (12 ).\nDestruction of medical records (13, 14):\nDestruction of medical records depend on time and on what type of medical record it is (ex. \nPaper records, electrical records, X -rays).\nGP records are usually kept for 10 years after the patient\u2019s death, records of children are kept \nuntil the patient is 25, or 8 years af ter their death\nDestruction of records are carried out according to the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act regulations. No records can be destroyed before the minimum time \nrequired for the medical documentation has been met. The method they are destroyed are ", "6": "7usually by shredding and pulverization, electronic data are destroyed through disposal and \nservicing.\nMedical records are property of patient or the medical institution (15):\nMost of the medical records are property of the medical institution , however the patient is \nallowed to ask for a copy of the treatment records and should be handed the records within 72 \nhours.\nThe hospi tal must keep the medical records confidential and are not allowed to release any\ninformation. There are special c ircumstances in which there may be exceptions to this rule.", "7": "8Discussion\nWhen reviewing a medical record in court, the lawyer of the prosecutor will try to look for \nany information that might be weak or missed and stick to it in order to sue the healthcare \nprofessional . It can be anything from the time of the documentation to failed communication \nbetween hospital staff and patients (16).\nSo is it important to make medical documentation? In today\u2019s society I think that as a medical \nstaff in a h ospital itis very important to make a medical documentation . As David Carp says -\nmedical documentation is not only for the patients\u2019 safety but also for the physicians\u2019\ndefensibility (17 ).\nThe documentation has to be complete, the physician must note everything they do, see,or \nhear, and they must observe everything. If they feel something is out of the norm or if they \nsay something to the patient they have to put it in to the medical documentation (18 ).\nBy taking proper information from a patient and putting it down in writing ,or storing itwill \nnot only benefit thepatient but also the healthcare staff, there will be no mistakes or missing  \ninformation that ma y harm the patient later on,and ifthe patient would compla in or blame the \nstaff for missing s ome information there will be written proof that thisis false.\nI think this topic should be more stressed in the hospitals, it is very easy for a doctor or nurse \nto miss out important information and cause apatient harm. If there is a form to follow that \nhelps the staff to collect all information and make a proper medical data this can be avoided , \nbut the medical staff should be aware of this by them self as well and take notes for what they \nthink is important , someone who works in the medical industry should never close their eyes \nif they see something they have doubts about they should write it down in their data and the \nshould not be afraid of asking another physician for advice, as this might help them later in a \nlegal case.", "8": "9Making a correct medical d ata is also important for the medical staff ,since these daysa lot of \npatients try tomake money bysuing hospitals and medical health care workers for any little \nmistake or misunderstanding ,even by making up scenarios of things that did not occur. This \nwould be easier to prevent if the physician swould make their documentation properly ,and \nput down every information ,by making these proper medical documentations these lawsuits \ncould be avoided and would save the hospital sandthe physicians a great amoun t of money \nand even their license to practice and in worst case jail .\nI also think that the electronic health recorder is a better way to work with than the paper \nbased system ,because it is easier to store and keep everything in order and to access the \ninformation needed , with paper based system there will not be enough storage and it is much \nmore time consuming and messy tofind information ,also by using the paper based systems it \nis easier for information to be lost and misplaced and misunderstandings frequently happen.\nBy using a computerized method the medical staff will avoid misunderstandings, bad \nhandwriting etc. This will avoid creating danger ous situations forthepatient s, justbecause \nthey read something wrong and prescribed the wrong medication .\nI think it is important to work with more modern approaches for these type of things not to \nhappen and as it is easier and less time consuming and more precise.", "9": "10Conclusion\nMedical documentation should be m ade properly ,with awareness for the patients\u2019safety ,and \nalso for avoiding misunderstanding sand lawsuits that should never have taken place orcould \nhave easily been avoided in the first place .", "10": "11References\n1.Medical record documentation and understanding legalaspects for certified \nnursing.
